First and foremost, Vote. Especially if you live in Pennsylvania. If you are registered in Pennsylvania, you should vote in person. You can [find a polling place here](https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-at-a-Polling-Place.aspx).

If you need help getting to the your polling place, call someone. If you are registered with a political party, call your county party office. They want you to vote and will help.

Pennsylvanians may decide this election and every vote cast in Pennsylvania matters and should be counted.

Second, I think you should vote for Joe Biden for President. I did. This is the first time I've supported a Democrat for President. I worked for [Senator Rick Santorum](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/27054/rick-santorum). I interned at the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/about-heritage/mission) and the [Commonwealth Foundation](https://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/about/). I went to Grove [City College](http://www.gcc.edu/Home/Our-Story/Faith-Freedom). I am not a socialist.

On July 25, 2020, [President Trump had a phone call with the President of Ukraine](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-ukraine-call-transcript-read-the-document):

> "There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...It sounds horrible to me."

The President of the United States asked a foreign leader to investigate his opponent. This is not acceptable behavior.

Imagine if your kid, or niece, told you they asked some kids from the next town over to dig up dirt on the person they were running against for Class President. Would you be excited about that? Would that be behavior you encourage or discourage?

I expect more from the President of the United States. I think you should as well.
