<p>
I like making simple things. Of course since I'm not the most handy in the real world, most of the simple things I make are made of 1's and 0's. Two things I'm most proud of I did in less than an hour.

</p>
<p>
The first is the <a href="http://conancomebackclock.com/">Conan Comeback Clock</a> I created it over my lunch hour the weekend before Conan went off the air. I used code I had orginally written for rescue missions to count down to Easter or Thanksgiving. Since January this page has had <span>25,897 visitors. If you look at this from a time per visitor perspective the site is very effective.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span>The second is <a href="http://www.masterworks.com/ntc/vendorbingo.htm">NTC Vendor Bingo</a>. I built this in response to a tweet from Amy Sample Ward that a bunch of vendors were cold calling her and others. Thanks to <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, I was able to set this up in about 1/2 an hour. You can see all the code right there on the page. This page saw a decent spike in visits before the conference and probably got Masterwork name in front of people who would have otherwise missed us.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span>With each the problem was obvious and the solution straightforward. The reward was not an elegant solution that advanced comuter science, but a simple one that hopefully brought a bit of joy.<br /></span>
