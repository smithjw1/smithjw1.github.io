I recently had a conversation about Detroit. I know it's very hipster to say good things about Detroit, but I had a great time there last summer. Far from a city guide, here were my favorite places in the city. 

## [Mercury Buger Bar](http://mercuryburgerbar.com/)
So nice we ate hear twice. We were going to go to Slows across the street, which I hear is also great. Amazing burgers, great beer selection. And if you are going paleo they will but your meat in a bowl.

## [Grand Trunk Pub](http://www.grandtrunk.pub/)
My cousin took me here for my very first meal in Detroit. I have returned many times. Absolutely amazing beer selection. I had [Bourbon County Stout](https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/goose-island-bourbon-county-stout/8909/) on tap there, amazing.

## [The Whisky Parlor](http://www.whiskyparlor.com/) 
Proud to say we were there for opening night. I had my first Japanese scotch. Unfortunatly it was after a few other ones so I don't recall the name.

## [Bucharest Grill](http://www.bucharestgrill.com/) 
Cheap big shawarma in a no nonsense bar. If you want a bunch of perfectly grilled meat and a Detroit Brewing lager this is your place.

## [Shinola](https://www.shinola.com/)
I got "my watch." there. I think it's important for a man to have a watch that will be passed down to his kids. It's not Swiss or gold, but it is special.

## [City Market Detroit](https://www.facebook.com/citymarketdetroit/)
Sorry for the Facebook link, but their website is down. This place was a lifesaver, a great grocery store in walking distance of downtown. I spent most of my time in the beer isle where I was able to get [Great Lakes Christmas](https://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/christmas-ale) in January, which is just unheard of. I also picked up a bottle of [Two James, Grass Widow Bourbon](http://twojames.com/our-spirits/?age-verified=14ef07cdc3). It's still mostly corn, but higher than usually rye make this a winner.

So apparently all I did in Detroit was eat and drink whiskey. Rest assured it was outside of the hours of the event I was there for. If you know what I mean, you know what I mean.
