A [study](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8558485/fracking-water-contamination-pennsylvania-study) found a small, regulatory permissible amount of toxic chemicals in drinking water.

It even goes on to say, that current regulation would have likely prevented this small contamination.

So you would expect drilling groups to say: "We told it was safe, this proves it."

But no, they basically deny the whole thing and try to make it seem like the study is a fraud. Why? Because only total acceptance of the fracking's salvific nature is allowed. Any doubters are charlatans.

It was a good study that clearly laid out the dangers of improper procedures and that the whole argument that the chemicals don't make it into drinking water is bunk. It's an important study to understand if safe fracking is possible, but instead of celebrating the industry dismisses it.

It is this disregard for even **supportive** but cautious science that makes me continue to seriously doubt the industries good faith.
