We all make choices that necessitate other choices we would rather not make. In other words we give up things for better things.

When I was a pastor's spouse I gave up worship. Perhaps that is not a universal experience for other Pastor's spouses, but it was mine.Â Today in worship I was able to sit with friends and truly to enjoy the beautiful music of other friends.

I've cried more in the past six months than I have in the past six years and I'm realizing that maybe 1/3 of the time those are tears of joy. This moring they certianly were.
