<p>
Recently I orderd some <a href="http://us.moo.com/en/">Moo Cards</a> to take to the NTC conference. I wanted to get a QR code on the back so my contact information would be scanable.

</p>
<p>
I got my order in the mail and attempted to scan them and they didn't work. The QR code wouldn't scan. I figured I was out the $20, but an email to Moo couldn't hurt.

</p>
<p>
What followed was a multi-email back and forth that ended with this email:

</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>
I created a new Illustrator file with vector text and your QR code.

<p />
Your order is reprinting and I checked the QR code again.

<p />
Everything works. =)

<p />
Best Regards,<br />Zachary

No extra charges, they sent me a new batch. That's what customer service should be.
