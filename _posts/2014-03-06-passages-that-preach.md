Some passages of scripture preach for themselves. Last night the Old Testament lesson was from [Isaiah.](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah+58:1-12&vnum=yes&version=nrsv)

Since scripture is meant to be heard more than read, I broke out the old podcasting mic:

Isaiah's words to Israel 2,400 years ago are true now. We say that we are a Christian nation blessed by God, but do we?

-   loose the bonds of injustice
-   let the oppressed go free
-   break every yoke
-   share our bread with the hungry
-   bring the homeless poor into our house
-   when we see the naked, cover them

That's what is acceptable, not [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_SB_1062)
