I'm a reasonable nervous flier. By that I mean I understand the fact that riding my bike in the city is more likely to get me hurt than flying. But I also know that it's an engineering masterpiece that is keeping me up there.

A British Company has proposed a [plane without windows](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037709/in-this-airplane-redesign-no-one-and-everyone-gets-a-window-seat), instead the whole fuselage is covered in OLEDs and is a giant screen.

This will mean the plane can be lighter with more interior space, saving fuel costs. The question is will people fly in it? The plane is no less safe than it was, but does it feel more like a flying death tube when you loose visual contact with the outside world?

It's a concept for now, but I'm interested in folks reaction. Would you fly in a plane where you couldn't spot [something on the wing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVxuHqmNpbI)
