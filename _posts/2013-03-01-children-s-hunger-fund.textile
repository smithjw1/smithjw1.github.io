Today I spent the day with "Children's Hunger Fund":http://www.chfus.org/ a newer client of Masterworks.

I talk about the ministries I work with from time to time, but I wanted to give these guys a special plug. They are doing it right on so many levels.

When you give to them you are helping not only distribute food to suffering children around the world, but that food is used to build relationships. Ever single "Food Pak":http://www.chfus.org/en/foodpak.html is handed ot a person by a person trying to build a relationship.

Hospitality is a core Christian tennet and Children's Hunger Fund practices this every day.
