You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.<br /> - Saint Augustine, Confessions (Lib 1,1-2,2.5,5: CSEL 33, 1-5)

Who knows if the actual quote from Augustine is anything like this, but I've heard this a lot and I've felt it's something I've need to hear.

<p>
Sometimes I wonder if God has made me to rest in restlessnes. Is that possible? Can it be my place in this world to be unsure of where I am? What does that mean for the people around me?

</p>
<p>
My first thought is, "How can I express this restlessness in a way that is constructive?" One answer is, writing. I can write about what I might like to be doing and maybe expereince enough of it to rest.
