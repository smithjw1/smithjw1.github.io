I recently attended my second Creative Mornings and heard this great talk by "Hillel Cooperman":http://hillelcooperman.com/ Rated "R" for adult language, but hilarious adult language.

I wouldn't call this a proscriptive talk, but a very personal descriptive exploration of imposter syndrome. Something that as a new entrepreneur I can completely understand.
