I'm excited announce that next week I'm starting at [WordPress VIP](https://wpvip.com/). I've been a WordPress and Automattic fan since the early 2000's. I've built dozen of sites using [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) over the years and spoken at two WordCamps Seattle.

There's all kinds of reason I'm making this change, but one of them is the amazing WordPress community. I wanted to take this moment to thank some members of that community that have helped me along the way.

First is the person who introduced me to WordPress: Joe Tan. Ironically, and inexplicable, Joe does not have a website. Whenever I have a technical problem I can't solve, WordPress or otherwise. Joe is my first call.

I can't talk about Joe without talking about [Michael Schafer](https://openbox9.com). Michael was Joe and my boss and Creative Directory at Silas Partners. No website there either because our wonderful start-up got acquired by a company to which I simply will not link.

I can wholeheartedly endorse Michael's design studio [openbox9](https://openbox9.com). If you are a non-profit, and if no one else can help, and if you can find them (not hard just click the link), these lovely people really are the A-Team.

Similarly a lot of love goes to [A Brave New](https://www.abravenew.com/). When Josh, Polly, and I started our little digital agency, who would know what it would become. I was able to lead the technical side of some amazing WordPress projects there. If you are a for-profit, look no futher.

Three last community member mentions. [Erik Teichman](https://www.eriktdesign.com/) for introducing me to Metabox.io. [Tracy Apps](http://tracyappsdesign.com/) for being the oldest WP G. I know. And [Jill Binder](https://jillbinder.com/) who is doing amazing work making sure the community is hearing from everyone.

I hope to be writing more in this space as I dive into Automattic and WordPress VIP. It's been a hard saying goodbye to Webconnex, but that's a subject for the [next post](/2020/06/23/Webconnex.html).
