A good post at <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/redesigned-facebook-logout-button/">Bokardo</a> about the Facebook logout button. The site isn't responding so I'm going to quote a good bit of the post.

<blockquote>
At the very least, interfaces should not lie. They should not deceive the people who use them into thinking something is true when it actually isn&rsquo;t.

<p />
Apparently, Facebook does not agree. On Sunday Nic Cubrilovic posted some troubling news: <a href="http://nikcub.appspot.com/logging-out-of-facebook-is-not-enough">Logging out of Facebook is not Enough</a>. Facebook doesn&rsquo;t actually log you out when you ask it to. They pretend to, but they don&rsquo;t. Instead, they simply change the status of your logged in session to fool you into thinking you&rsquo;re logged out.

<p />
You don&rsquo;t see your friends or profile. You don&rsquo;t view your feed. Even if you try to access your profile pages, Facebook will send you to the login screen. Except that you&rsquo;re not actually logged out. Every step of the way Facebook knows that it&rsquo;s you trying to access those pages. You&rsquo;re not really logged out, but Facebook is tricking you into thinking you are.

<p />
So, I&rsquo;ve designed a more appropriate Facebook logout button&hellip;instead of saying “Logout&rdquo; it now says “Logout (not really)”. This is more accurate and better reflects what&rsquo;s actually going on.

This is a good example of the difference between a technical user and a non-technical user. For a non-technical user being logged out means not being able to access your stuff without logging back in, this is exactly what Facebook is doing.

</p>
<p>
To a technical user, logged out means that you no longer know who I am so I'm browsing the site anonymously.

This is an interesting exercise in language. I agree with the conclusion that this is bad for privacy, I think from the perspective of the average user the interface is truthful.

What say you?
