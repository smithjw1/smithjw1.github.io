<p>My friend, Brian Evans, and I are riding from Pittsburgh (McKeesport) to Washington, D.C. this summer. Right now our route will take us on five trails (Great Allegheny Passage, C&amp;O Canal, W&amp;OD, 4-Mile Run, Mount Vernon) across five states (Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virgina, Virginia and the District of Columbia).</p><p>That's why the asterisk, technically it's four states and a federal district, but that doesn't really have a ring to it.</p><p>We're doing it in five days in July. Most folks take the trip in three or four days. We're doing it in five because we aren't starting until the afternoon of the first day. So it's really four days of riding, two half days for the first and fifth day and three full days of riding.</p><p>I'll be posting a bunch about this ride, including our route, gear, etc. So if you are at all interested about bicycle touring, stay tuned to the fivebythree tag, you can see <a href="http://jacobwaynesmith.posterous.com/tag/fivebythree">all posts about this here</a>.</p>
