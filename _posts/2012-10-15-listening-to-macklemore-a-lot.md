One of a the great lines from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz46DZkbSaY">Neon Cathedral</a>. Not the point he was trying to make, but certianly something I've found in my own faith life.

Once a week is not enough to keep my faith alive. I need choir on Wednesday and Basketball on Saturday morning and usually something else inbetween.

What do you need to keep your spirit topped up?
