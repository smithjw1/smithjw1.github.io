Our love of WordPress is well documented, so it makes sense we would also have an affinity towards [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/). WooCommerce is the leading eCommerce plugin for WordPress.

We do work on the Shopify platform and have had some unfortunate run-ins with Magento and Drupal Commerce. But for us, we have found an eCommerce home in WooCommerce.

It has all the simplicity and extensibility of WordPress and an amazing, dedicated team of developers at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). A conservative estimate says there will be $10 billion in transactions on WooCommerce stores in 2018. The platform is for real and ready for the primest of times.

As mentioned, we have used Shopify and it's a great way to get a shop up quickly. But if you want more control over the experience, you'll bounce against the platform before you know it. When you can't differentiate your user experience, you are losing brand equity. And that brand equity is what can geometrically increase your long-term customer value.

Example: Filament Brands
------------------------

We have been working with [Filament Brands](http://filamentbrands.com/) for the better part of a year. As a house of brands, they have six (and growing) independent eCommerce websites. Some are on Magento, others are on Shopify.

Filament came to us looking for a single platform that would work for their range of brands. They had some specific pain points that WooCommerce was able to solve.

*   Disparate code base that added to maintenance costs
*   High hosting costs for the Magento sites
*   Inability to test and optimize across brands
*   Complicated back-office integrations
*   Limited ability to make content and promotional updates
*   Multiple payment processors

We tackled all these challenges:

*   Single code base using WordPress multi-site
*   Powerful WP Engine hosting at 1/4 the cost
*   Streamlined checkout experience shared across all stores
*   Single import/export method across all stores
*   Full access to pages and promotional content
*   Single payment processor

We are halfway through the migration process and are already seeing the efficiencies of a single platform. And we couldn't have done any of it without WooCommerce.

Not Just for Physical Products
------------------------------

We have also built stores that sell downloadable products. The language and design around these products is more complicated, but using WooCommerce we are able to handle it with ease.

What Do You Want to Sell?
-------------------------

If you are looking to set your existing shop apart or jump into the online retail game, we can help. We've opened stores and watched the excitement of those first few sales and also managed stores with hundreds of transactions a day.

No matter your size, if there is a market for what you sell we can get you set up with a custom WooCommerce store that will meet your unique needs.

You can use a canned experience and see linear growth. Or have a streamlined, brand-love creating, ecommerce store that can change the trajectory of that revenue line.
