Christina loves to ski and I love her, so knowing that I am going to fall repeatedly over a weekend is worth it. Nordic skiing isn't a thing where I'm from. Downhill is relegated to what most Seattle folks would call a bunny slope. But I've fond gliding on a pair of skis through a winter postcard wonderland is a uniquely Seattle experience for me. Something I'm excited to share.

If you haven't tried it, it's less than $100 to get out for a weekend and rent the gear, you should try.
