title: What I like about Craft

My friend Doug first introduced me to "Craft":https://buildwithcraft.com/. Doug works at the very excellent Viget Labs who just published an equally excellent post about "Craft vs. Wordpress":http://viget.com/extend/craft-vs.-wordpress-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-data#When:13:00

I am a WordPress guy. I've recommended it dozens of times, built personal and business sites with it, written a plugin... I'm a WordPress guy. But I really like Craft.

The post speaks to the biggest reason: native, admin driven custom post types. Megan Zlock, the author of the post, mentions this functionality is possible with a WordPress plugin, but when it's not baked into the CMS you are bound for trouble.

I haven't quite figured out how to sell folks on the $300 price tag, but if you are a WordPress developer, spend some time to take a look at Craft.
