On this week's episode we discuss an article from Smashing Magazine: [Mobile First is Just Not Good Enough: Meet Journey-Driven Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/mobile-first-is-just-not-good-enough-meet-journey-driven-design/).

We start the podcast talking about what the term "mobile first" means to us. Turns out, our approach could more accurately be called "mobile at the same time." We don't do mobile designs first. We do them alongside desktop designs.

Many of the concepts inherent in a journey-driven design process are powerful. But we are skeptical of some of the article's bolder claims.

We mention a favorite author and blog, Ian Lurie over at [Portent](https://www.portent.com/blog). You should read his post on [world building](https://www.portent.com/blog/internet-marketing/no-more-marketing-storytelling-digital-worldbuilding.htm).
