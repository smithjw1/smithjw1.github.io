<p>Tomorrow Erin and I head to Ligonier, PA for a Smith/Berkebile vacation. We are going to <a href="http://www.idlewild.com/">Idlewild</a> amusement park Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Mom and Dad picked Idlewild because it is centralish and is specifically geared for smaller kids, of which we have two. I'm excited to spend time with the family and to meet my new niece. I hear she is cool.</p><p>After breakfast on Wednesday we go to McKeesport so I can meet up with Brian and we can start our <a href="http://shoeinthedoor.com/tag/fivebythree">FiveByThree</a> ride from Pittsburgh to D.C.
