Seattle is becoming home. Being away has a way of making that clear. <p>It's not the Seattle I left, I didn't expect it to be of course. The city changes, relationships change and I've changed. </p><p>I was reminded last night that those closest to me want what I want: contentment. Even if that means living 3,000 miles away. </p><p>If I were to describe what it feels like in terms of a drink recipe:</p><p>2 parts excitement <br />1 part sadness leaving family<br />Nervousness about making a new life to fill. </p><p>I've been making a new life for myself in Seattle but I haven't committed to it. Now I can and I with God's help I will.</p>
