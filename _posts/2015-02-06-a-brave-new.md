Many of you know that I left Masterworks in September. What most of you don't know is that I've been working on a partnership with two longtime colleagues and friends, it's called [A Brave New](http://abravenew.com)

I can't tell you how excited and pleased I am to be starting this new company/adventure. It's the culmination of a lot of work and inspiration. The support of my family, the example of entrepreneurs, the encouragement of teachers and mentors and the fellowship of friends all played a part.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

And I'd like to ask you to do one more thing for me: spread the word. A Brave New is ready to help nonprofits and small business tell their story and expand their reach. If that sounds like something someone you know could use, drop an email or a tweet or a phone call.

So check out [the new website](http://abravenew.com) [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/abravenew) and keep in touch. We are going to have some fun.
