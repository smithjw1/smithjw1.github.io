Have you used your phone in a meeting? Have you? What if your boss 'lost it' and demanded all phones are banned in meeting. Well that happened and was reported in  [this article](https://twitter.com/JimBourke/status/996760027087155200) from the Wall Street Journal. Excuse the link to a twitter status to avoid the WSJ paywall.

Listen as Josh, Jacob and Polly discuss how we use phones at A Brave New, how to create interesting meetings, and how to eat Skittles during a podcast.
