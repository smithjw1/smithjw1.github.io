Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is a required aspect of any healthy digital marketing mix. It's a perfect compliment to all of the ways that you're earning attention through great content and quality product. We see it as a vital way to introduce yourself to new customers and donors.

If you're a nonprofit, Google Grants can give you $10,000 of free advertising a month. If you aren't using it, you're leaving money on the table. More importantly, you're missing the chance to meet people who are passionate about the product you sell, the service you provide, or the cause you champion.

If you're a business, you can't access Google Grants, but we can still help you cover the cost of customer acquisition. We can help you implement proven strategies that will return positive ROI from the get go.

Hundreds of firms can set up and manage an SEM campaign for your organization, so why work with us?

1.  **Results:** every campaign (but one) we've managed has seen long term, positive ROI. The one that didn't see positive ROI, we cut halfway through the campaign. If it isn't working, we'll be the first to tell you and save you further cost.
2.  **Coherent Content Strategy:** without a plan to move people from interest to action, leads don't mean much. Before we launch a campaign, we make sure there is a plan in place to nurture new leads with relevant, timely content.
3.  **Superior Technical Execution:** setting up a campaign is easy. Properly tracking results and revenue isn't. You'll know just how the campaign is going using the real time tools built into Google Analytics.

We know how to find you new customers and donors that will pay for themselves. And if you're a nonprofit, you can find them without paying a dime for advertising.

If this sounds interesting to you, [get in touch](../../../../../com/abravenew/blog/index.html) and we'll do a free audit of your existing search program to see how we can help.
