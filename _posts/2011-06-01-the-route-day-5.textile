<p>Our last day is another 1/2 day with only 44 miles of riding and takes us on three (sort of) different trails. If your doing the math, that's actually six trails not five. We'll get to that.</p><p></p><p>The day starts on the W&amp;OD trail, it's another rail trail that runs from just north of Leesburg to Shirlington outside of DC. It's a rather busy trail, but it's paved and sets us up for a better entry into D.C.</p><p>I'm guessing we'll sleep in a bit, since we can, and stop in Vienna, VA for lunch. That way we can check out Norm's beer store, a favorite from my time living in NOVA.</p><p>The Four-Mile Run trail connects the WO&amp;D to the Mount Vernon trail. I'm not counting Four-Mile Run, since we are going to be on it for just over two miles.</p><p>Our final trail takes us past Ronald Regan airport and across the Arlington Memorial Bridge. The Memorial Bridge runs right up to the back of the Lincoln Memorial and provides the most visually impressive way in and out of D.C. We'll take surface streets to Union Station, drop off our bikes and get a well deserved beer at Cap City.</p>
