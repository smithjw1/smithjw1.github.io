I recently got a new helmet ahead of?? the big charity ride I'm doing this weekend. My old helmet was a nice one, it matched my bike, it was comfortable and safe.

However, it didn't have the ventilation that most other bike helmets do. It was a gift so I don't want to talk bad about it, but there are better helmets out there in terms of weight and ventilation. Keeping your head cool isn't just a nice thing. I would sweat enough in my old helmet that it would run into my eyes. Not the best thing when you are speeding downhill at 30 miles an hour.

Erin offered to buy me a new helmet last year for my birthday, why did it take so long for me to follow through? Because last year on this charity ride, one of the marshals at a turn said she liked my helmet.

That's right because some complete stranger said they liked my somewhat behind the times helmet I kept it for nearly a year. And it was only when the old helmet fell apart a bit that I bought the new one.

One lady makes one comment and I can't get rid of my helmet because I think I look good. It never crossed my mind that she said that to all the riders. Words of encouragement are important out on the road and perhaps she was providing that.

I sometimes forget how much what other people say influences beyond rationality. It makes what I do everyday - try to get people to donate to nonprofits - seem even more like throwing darts.
