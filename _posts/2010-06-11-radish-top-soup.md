<p>
Erin and I joined a CSA or Community Supported Agriculture plan this summer. A local farmer sells shares and people in the community buy them to support the farm. Its a great way to get local produce cheaply.

The "downside" is that you don't get to pick what you get. So this week we got a bunch of radishes, tops and all. Neither Erin nor I had ever used radish greens, but thanks to the internet it was easy to find a recipe.I settled on <a href="http://www.mariquita.com/recipes/radish.html">Radish Top Soup</a>

I felt inspired tonight so I cooked it up tonight and filmed the steps.

I hope to do this each week as we learn old ways of cooking new things.
