I cried and was comforted last night, I wanted to know that the way I felt wasn't an overreaction, but the way you should feel when you have to say goodbye. I wanted to share all that my friend meant to me with the world, so they would know it's alright for me to feel this way.

You step into the blue-grey, orange streetlamp punctuated light of dawn with some distance. You realize that no words can sum up any connection, any experience. You realize that while opening a window on a relationship doesn't cheapen it, it certainly isn't about others understanding, it is about validating yourself.

Many know what it is to watch someone walk down their path, knowing it is a path we can no longer walk with them on. We have all felt the joy and sorry of goodbye.
