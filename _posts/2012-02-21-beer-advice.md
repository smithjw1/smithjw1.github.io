<p>
A friend asked me for some beers to try and I thought others could use the info. He likes cigars so some of this advice is based on that.

</p>
<p>
<span>First resource is the show notes from the Podcast Jim and I did a few years back: </span><a href="http://yournextbeer.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://yournextbeer.wordpress.com/</a>

</p>
<p>
<span>The audio isn't online, but, you can read the reviews. A list of 115 isn't&nbsp;</span><span>much of a list. So here are some general thoughts.</span>

<p />
<strong><span>Session vs. Big</span></strong><br /><span>First thing is to decide how you are drinking, one beer or six. You&nbsp;</span><span>need different kind of beers for different purposes. If you you want&nbsp;</span><span>one nice beer with a cigar look for beers labeled double, tripple or</span><br /><span>imperial. If you want a few, stick with something lighter.</span>

<p />
<strong><span>Malty vs. Hoppy</span></strong><br /><span>Hops are the bitter, malty is the bread like taste. I'm not a huge&nbsp;</span><span>malt guy but it has it's place. Belgians tend to be rather malty so I&nbsp;</span><span>avoid them. IPA's are the top of hop spectrum usually. Once you get&nbsp;</span><span>hoppy enough they tend to get a little grapefruit taste as well, which&nbsp;</span><span>can be quite nice. Hoppy beers are great with spicy food.</span>

<p />
<span>A few styles to try:</span><br />

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Barley Wine. Almost like port, sweet alcoholic and all malt, unless it's been aged in barrels then it can get interesting.</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>Amber or Double/Imperial Amber. A good hop/malt  balance usually you&nbsp;</span><span>can drink ambers all night an imperial is usually going to be on the&nbsp;</span><span>hoppier side.</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>Porter (esp. Smoked). One of my favorite styles similar to a stout&nbsp;</span><span>but less creamy and the smoked varieties would be perfect with a cigar</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>Saison/Farm house/Bier de Garde. All slightly different, but all&nbsp;</span><span>light, highly carbonated and refreshing. A cigar would kill these&nbsp;</span><span>beers, but perfect or an afternoon out on the deck or with first&nbsp;</span><span>course/appetizers</span>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span>Some breweries to look out for:</span><br />

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Stone. I like everything they do, their Smoked Porter should be a&nbsp;</span><span>first stop</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>Green Flash. Their West Coast IPA is my favorite and Le Freak is&nbsp;</span><span>perhaps my favorite beer right now.</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>Firestone Walker. Haven't had much as they don't distribute out&nbsp;</span><span>East but have a great reputation</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>Shiner. Obviously you know about Shiner Bock but their "Family" mixed&nbsp;</span><span>case is usually a good value. Their Light is the best Light I've had&nbsp;</span><span>and perfect for BBQ's or cooking with. Their Hefeweisen is also very&nbsp;</span><span>good.</span>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color:#222222;font-family:arial, sans-serif;">That should get just about anyone started. If your wondering what your next beer should be, leave a comment.</span>
