I've been interested in trying out [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the fact that my hosting service needed renewal game me a good reason.

The hardest part was adding the necessary Ruby Gems. I went the not-cool-but-oh-so-easy route of a `sudo` install and all was well. With the exception of having to run the importer as root, which meant that all the posts were owned by root. A simple chown solved that.

I've been doing a lot more development lately, stuff that doesn't make sense on the [A Brave New Blog](http://abravenew.com/blog) maybe I'll write some more about that here, no promises.
