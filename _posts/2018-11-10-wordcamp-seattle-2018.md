This is my second year at WordCamp and I'm excited to learn more about creating content and this thing called Gutenberg? Perhaps you've heard of it.

This is how I take notes, so any errors are likely mine not the speaker. I'll be updating this as we go through the weekend.

Keynote: Bridget Willard – Community: Observe, Include, Accept
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bridget is from Orange County. And is Orange County excited for a Seattle crowd. At 9am. On a Saturday. It's difficult.

+ Community is not just a noun, it's a verb
+ We are all just working on a group project like it's 4th grade -- and sometimes we fight like it too
+ We are wired to be connected to each other, and when we are deprived of that connection it affects us spiritually, emotionally, physically
+ "It's so illegally cold in Minnesota"
+ "If you keep talking, I'm going to call on you, because I have a great view."
+ "Did you know that these are all your friends? Sometimes it just helps to hear it." Life happens to people (tell me about it), we need to hold each other in those times
+ Nouns have no meaning, if the behavior doesn't go with it
+ We like to think we make logical decisions, but we make emotional decisions and reverse engineer the logic
+ “We can’t build this thing called WordPress if we all think the same.”
+ Our computers are de-humanizing

She's really talking about hospitality, which is a core value of Christianity (at least as I practice it). It is fascinating to hear someone basically preach on The Sermon on the Mount, but from a totally secular perspective. Observe, Include, and Accept as core values are values of the WordPress community and of the Christian community.

I know that may come as a surprise, based on how Christianity is practiced in the United States today, but for me, and my community it's true.
