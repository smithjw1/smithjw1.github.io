title:  WordCamp Seattle 2018
tags: []
---
This is my second year at WordCamp and I'm excited to learn more about creating content and this thing called Gutenberg? Perhaps you've heard of it.

This is how I take notes, so any errors are likely mine not the speaker. I'll be updating this as we go through the weekend.

Keynote: Bridget Willard – Community: Observe, Include, Accept
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bridget is from Orange County. And is Orange County excited for a Seattle crowd. At 9am. On a Saturday. It's difficult.

+ Community is not just a noun, it's a verb
+ We are all just working on a group project like it's 4th grade -- and sometimes we fight like it too
+ We are wired to be connected to each other, and when we are deprived of that connection it affects us spiritually, emotionally, physically
+ "It's so illegally cold in Minnesota"
+ "If you keep talking, I'm going to call on you, because I have a great view."
+ "Did you know that these are all your friends? Sometimes it just helps to hear it." Life happens to people (tell me about it), we need to hold each other in those times
+ Nouns have no meaning, if the behavior doesn't go with it
+ We like to think we make logical decisions, but we make emotional decisions and reverse engineer the logic
+ “We can’t build this thing called WordPress if we all think the same.”
+ Our computers are de-humanizing

She's really talking about hospitality, which is a core value of Christianity (at least as I practice it). It is fascinating to hear someone basically preach on The Sermon on the Mount, but from a totally secular perspective. Observe, Include, and Accept as core values are values of the WordPress community and of the Christian community.

I know that may come as a surprise, based on how Christianity is practiced in the United States today, but for me, and my community it's true.

Andrew Taylor - The Benefits of Testing and Automation
--------------------------------------------------------------
He is a maintainer of websites. We pick up projects and we have to keep them going over time.

+ Maybe there is a better way than shoving everything on a staging site
+ Instead if you test continuously, after every change less messes to detangle
+ Checking things you didn't work on is boring, time consuming, and hard to bill
+ Automated testing is the road less traveled
+ Visual regression as baseline - [Backstop JS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJ)
+ Examining performance - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

Automated testing is important in WordPress, but even more important with the work I'm doing at [WebConnex](http;//webconnex.com). Implementing visual regression testing is on my list to get started on day 1, the performance testing will actually be a bit easier to implement.

Jonathan Peck - The other WPML: Machine Learning / Ai in WordPress
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Advocate for [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/), which does Machine Learning hosting. What follows are ideas for how we could use this at WebConnex.

+ Recommender engine - show the right race length
+ AI based, dynamic ambassador discount
+ Use tweet sentiment to figure out how people feel about the event
+ Team name/GroupRev suggestion based on past performance
+ Suggestion on fields to add/remove based on performance
+ Object detection for alt tags of images
+ Text summarization for meta descriptions
+ Automated statement images for social media (Cloudinary)

This talked walked a fine line between pitch and information. I think it ended up fairly pitchy, but the service looks helpful, so I care a bit less.


Taylor Waldon - Making Content Part of Company Culture
-------------------------------------------------------
Taylor has been doing content since college working at a food service company.

+ Basic permission marketing thinking create: relevant, timely, expected
+ If you are creating the content out of the final publishing medium, you need to re-edit
+ Content Matrix

   | **Hooks** | **Persona 1** | **Persona 2** |
   | Value | Key Message | Key Message |

+ Blog Post Template
  + title
  + author
  + category
  + image direction
  + target audience
  + offer/value
  + keyword
  + hook/meta description
+ Schedule, free Google calendar if you need more [CoSchedule](https://coschedule.com/)

This talk was done in 20 minutes. It was actually a significantly dense introduction to content management. As someone immersed in that world for years it was helpful. If I were brand new, I don't think I would have gotten as much out of it.

Bob Dunn - How to Repurpose a Single Piece of Content Into a Lot of Content
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I turned a camera on for this session and counted people there were 90 people +/- 5 at this session.

+ Internal links give Google a roadmap for your website, basically pillar pages
+ Updating content is the biggest way he grows his traffic
  + Tweaks: add content, links to newer posts, but all in context
  + Turns: revive or bury posts, deleting is the easy way with redirect, harder way is to rethink
  + Twists: save as draft, rewrite, and schedule
+ Set up links as post title (no dates in URL)
+ Use audio and video (duh), turn audio into videoless video, less duh
+ [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to transcribe text posts to audio
+ Extractions: Inverviews, tips, lists
+ One post serves all
  + Monday: email list
  + Tuesday: blog
  + Wednesday: talking head video
  + Thursday: podcast
+ When re-using content make sure to use canonical URLs for your extractions
+ He's tried time and again to make money from his most popular blog post, but he just can't - he just makes people happy

It's a good reminder to look at content after it's published and re-link it to more modern content.
