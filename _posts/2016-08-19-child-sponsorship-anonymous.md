This week we discuss an article from the New York Times about [child sponsorship](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/middleeast/worldvision-palestinians-sponsor-a-child.html). The author of the article tracked down a sponsored child for a man in Australia. While the child's community had seen benefit, the child and his family weren't aware that someone half-a-world away had been sending money for more than a decade to World Vision to help the child.

We discuss the fine line between being completely transparent with your donors and using an offer that you know will generate donations. Having worked with and for child sponsorship organizations, this story wasn't a surprise to us. We also know that things have changed since this child was first sponsored in 1998. New sponsors today have a much better understanding of where their dollars go.

We also find out that Josh has a knowledge of 1980's era airline ticket prices.
