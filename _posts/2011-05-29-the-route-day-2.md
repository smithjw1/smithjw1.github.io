The second day is our biggest day, ninety-five miles. We'll be passing through Confluence, Meyersdale and ending up in Cumberland, MD.

I'm not too worried about the distance, if you look at the profile we cross over the Eastern Continental Divide just past Myersdale. We'll loose 1,787 feet in about twenty-five miles or 71 feet per mile. So it's technically downhill, but barely.

We're stopping at Sister's Cafe in Confluence but the Lucky Dog Cafe looks promising as well. I'm sure we'll be hungry enough it won't much matter.

Dinner is at the GI Day Room Coffee Shop in Myersdale that allegedly treats trail riders like "royalty." With 32 miles left to go on the day, I want to make sure we get a meal that doesn't weigh us down.

We'll exit the Great Allegheny Passage trail in Cumberland and ride a mile or so to the YMCA to setup camp, and sleep very well.
