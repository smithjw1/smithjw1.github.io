It is also imaginable that Wal-Mart could set up in-store payment kiosks away from the registers with the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/one-click_buying_comes_to_real_life_with_square_re.php">Square Register</a>. It could just be a little booth in every department of a Wal-Mart that would be designed to handle payments for a couple of items.

The big win here is for the little guy. With millions of transactions running from Wal-Mart, Square should be able to lower transaction fees for everyone.

Of course they may pocket the difference and not lower the little guys fees, but a stable giving platform is still good for the little guys.
