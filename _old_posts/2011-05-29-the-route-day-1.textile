<p>First question should be, why five days? Most people do this in three or four days. Well two big reasons.</p><p>First, the best train back from Washington leaves at 4:05pm. So if we did four days, the last day we could be hustling to get a train - not fun.</p><p>Second, before we leave the Smith's and Berkebile's are taking a vacation. I don't want to cut that short, so starting the first day around noon made sense.</p><p></p><p>The first day we are starting from Brian's house and heading the wrong direction for a few miles so we can start at the McKeesport trail head. Apparently, Brian is some sort of trail hall monitor and they want to get his picture starting our trip.</p><p>The first day is designed to ease us into riding and give us plenty of time to setup camp the first night. We'll be staying at <a href="http://www.campriversedge.com/">River's Edge Campgound and Cabins</a>, just outside of Connellsvile, PA. We'll be following the Youghiogheny (<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">j??k??????e??ni</span>) River all day today, so I expect lots of bridges and old industrial parks.</p>
