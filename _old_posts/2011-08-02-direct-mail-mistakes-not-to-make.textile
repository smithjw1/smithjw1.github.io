<p>Great <a href="http://www.sofii.org/node/782">direct mail advice</a> although I can't agree with #25 and #34.</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><strong>Mistake 25:</strong> writing a package and then surrendering it  to an artist.&nbsp; Lean over the artist&rsquo;s shoulder all the way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your  package.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t just give verbal instructions.&nbsp; Make a rough pencil  layout.&nbsp; The artist&rsquo;s responsibility is to enhance your concept to make  the package visually exciting &ndash; but only within the framework of your  vision for the package.</blockquote><p>This makes it seem like artists, left on their own, will always detract from effectiveness. The best work we see is when artist and writers collaborate.</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><strong>Mistake 34: </strong>failing to understand that the only reason  you write to $10 and under donors is to motivate them to step up to a  higher level.&nbsp; If you let them stay at $10, your fundraising costs may  be embarrassingly high.&nbsp; So learn all you can about upgrading  techniques.</blockquote><p>We've found at <a href="http://www.masterworks.com">Masterworks</a> that donors who give you less than around $20 on a first gift never give enough subsequently to make up for it. Perhaps in other areas of direct marketing it's different, but with our clients it is better to stop mailing $10 donors than try to upgrade.</p>
