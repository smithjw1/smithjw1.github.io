After six years at Masterworks and five before that at Silas Partners, I've decided it's time to start something brand new.

Today is my first day as a freelancer.

Reflecting on the digital world in June of 2003 when I got started, the change is staggering. There was no Facebook or Twitter, in fact MySpace wouldn't even start until two months after I did. Friendster was the social network (although we didn't call it that) of choice.

Being my own boss feels like the best way to walk with nonprofits and small businesses in this "World without Pants":http://www.amazon.com/The-Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com/dp/1118660633.

If we've worked together at Masterworks, chances are we are still working together. If we haven't been able to work together before, please "drop a line":mailto:jake@shoeinthedoor.com, we're open for business.
