<p>This morning I wrote the first lines to a musical one I'm unlikley to get any further than what is here.<div class='p_embed p_audio_embed'><a href="/files/1029539-Life_is_a_Funny_Thing.mp3"><div class='p_icon'></div><div class='p_text'>Life_is_a_Funny_Thing.mp3</div></a></div></p><p>When I ride my bike down Hubble Place there is a strech between 8th and 9th where you are so close to I-5 that you can say, sing, scream whatever you want with no chance of anyone ever hearing you.</p><p>This morning I wrote the first lines to a musical, "Life is a funny thing." I imagined the characters all waking up and their primary conflict being introduced to the audience in the opening song. "Love is a funny thing," "work is a funny thing," "death is a funny thing," etc.&nbsp;</p><p>But this post isn't about my nacent musical (non)talent. It's about having a place where you can shout at the world. Not a blog or twitter that certianly provide that, but an actual real place.</p><p>Through those two blocks I've blessed, I've cursed, I've sang, I've shouted and every time I come out feeling better than I went in.</p>
