<h2>Initial Impressions</h2>
<p>If you aren't quite sure where to go, you usually you just follow the balding middle aged (for the industry which means 32) men. That wouldn't have worked at SEED.</p>

<p>Breakfast is as one would expect: awkward. Coders don't mix well with anyone, designers are too busy figuring out if their glasses are the hippest in the room, and sales people make everyone uncomfortable. The sales types are the easiest to spot in their "laid back" suit with no tie.</p>

<p>Another thing that struck me is there was more "product" in the guy's hair than the women's hair. These conferences are probably the few places where that happens. It's really an untapped sponsorship opportunity.</p>

<h2>What I learned at SEED</h2>
<p>I had to give a presentation all "what I learned this summer" style. I've included the flash here. Without me talking it may not make much sense, but for what it's worth here it is.</p>
