<p>Our last full day has us in three states, all on the C&amp;O canal trail. This day will have the most to see with stops in Sharpsburg, MD and Harper's Ferry and a night in a real bed in Leesburg, VA.</p><p></p><p>Another day spent on the Maryland, West Virgina border. Today, our last day on the C&amp;O Trail will take us 77 miles.</p><p>Our first stop is the longest single leg of the trip at 39 miles to Sharpsburg, MD. We may start in Williamsport, MD for a snack, that is if Brian starts complaining. We'll be eating at Gege's Place which I'm intrigued by as it is described as, "<span class="snippet">a cross between a restaurant, saloon, biker bar, and pool hall." My only concern is they are a pizza place and Brian is claiming to be lactose intolerant.</span></p><p><span class="snippet">We'll be stopping in just tweleve more miles in Harper's Ferry, WV. This is Brian's request, but I'm excited since I've never been. No big plans here, just roll through and get a snack.</span></p><p><span class="snippet">The last bit of the day is exciting as well. We'll be taking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Whites-Ferry/79695133660">White's Ferry</a>, the last operating ferry on the Potamac river. From the Virginia side of the river the fine folks at the The <a href="http://www.theleesburgcolonialinn.com/">Leesburg Colonial Inn</a> will pick us up and take us into town for a night in a bed. <br /></span></p>
