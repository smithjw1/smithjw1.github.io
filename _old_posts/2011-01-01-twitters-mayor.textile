<p>Cory Booker is the mayor of Newark and has been dubbed "Twitter's Mayor" by Vanity Fair.</p><p>He's been tweeting for a while now. The last time he got some noteriarty from his Twitter use was when he and Conan O'Brien had a dust up of Newark jokes that ended in a $100,000 to Booker's Newark centered chairity. Not bad.</p><p>This past week <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/corybooker">@CoryBooker</a> by responding personally to resident's tweets about the snow storm. Vanity Fair covered the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/12/the-10-most-valiant-snow-rescue-tweets-from-cory-booker-twitters-mayor.html">ten most valiant</a>.</p><p>We've talked a lot about how to raise money with social networking, but i believe the real value is using these channels like these for customer/constiuent/donor service. Just like Mr. Booker did.</p><p>He has seen some backlash, with folks asking why he isn't doing "real work." My use of quotes should make it obvious that I think Mr. Booker is indeed doing real work. It seems to me connecting directly with constiuents is a much better use of time in a crisis than micro-managing the people who are being paid to do the real work.</p><p>Who inside your organization could benefit from some direct, frank interaction with donors?</p>
