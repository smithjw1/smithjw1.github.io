The very first web conference I attended was the second ever An Event Apart in Atlanta in 2006. Don't believe me, here I am [eating a hamburger](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joetan/123020785/in/pool-aeaatlanta2006/).

I remember that trip and that day well. I specifically remember Zeldman's advice to never respond to an RFP longer than two pages, because the client has already planned the process for you.

It will be 11 years to the day since my last An Event Apart and I'm proud to be part of the [blue beanie](http://bluebeanieday.tumblr.com/) wearing club for all that time.
