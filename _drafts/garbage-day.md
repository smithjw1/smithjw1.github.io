Having a dog in your life means picking up shit, there are no two ways around that. However, the distance you carry it is not always equal. Garbage day is the shortest carrying time.

Every other day your trash can is off limits. Even if it's on the curb, even if there are other feces filled bags in there, that's your trash and I will not trespass.

Communal dumpsters are another mater. When they are far away from the apartment building and not near overflowing, I feel like they are fair game. Part of this is from when I lived in such a building and often had to navigate the horrible smell when dumping my trash. But it's a communal dumpster and the upstair's neighbors rotting Top Ramen could be just as likely a culprit.

But on garbage day, with your can on the curb, I feel like it's fine to deposit my bag. But only *before* the garbage truck has come by. There are few worse feelings then hauling a can back into your house only to find a lonely, soggy bag of shit at the bottom.

I don't know why it's soggy, but it always is. It's probably better that I do not know.

So if you see me dropping a bag of shit into your garbage can or dumpster, know that I have thought long and hard about the moral implications of my actions.
