Before last year I never had been on skis. Last week I felt like a ski god.

Christina loves to ski and I love her, so knowing that I am going to fall repeadetly over a weekend is worth it.

Nordic skiing isn't a thing where I'm from. Downhill is relegated to what most Seattle folks would call a bunny slope.




I've fallen in love with classic cross country skiing. If you haven't tried it, it's less than $100 to get out for a weekend and rent the gear, you should try.

Gliding on a pair of skis through a winter postcard wonderland is a uniquely Seattle experience for me. Something I'm excited to share.

So if I'm not replying to emails on Friday afternoons in the winter, you may find me at cabin creek, or if I'm very lucky Winthrop.
