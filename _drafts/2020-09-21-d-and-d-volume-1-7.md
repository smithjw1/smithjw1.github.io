## Bryce

The wolf was the chief. The beast that we say slay two villagers before our eyes was the very man sworn to protect this place.

What have we walked into.

We wanted us to protect this village, all the while he was hunting it? He needed us to stand up to a dozen men, when he could turn into a fire breathing, ten foot tall, wolf. That, oh by the way, can blink in and out of existence and move at will.

Something is not right. We spent all day planning for the arrival of Lady Sky's men who will be here in a few hours when the sun comes up. Our plan to dangle the chief as tribute will have to be revised.

The Lady's flames mingled with the green flames of the beast, but seemed to do it little harm. I feel like the buzzing of a fly when my companions arrows and blades sink deep into our foes.

I'm currently playing through a campaign DM'd by the indomitable [Erik Maxwell](http://erikmaxwell.co/). As a writing exercise I'm giving myself 30 minutes to recap our weekly adventures.
