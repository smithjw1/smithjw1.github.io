    <p>
For the past week I've been in New Orleans for the 2012 ELCA Youth Gathering.

</p>
<p>
I was part of a team of four other exceptional people and had a great time. I've done five other gatherings, but this one was by far the most impactful from my point of view.

</p>
<p>
For me, the heart of the gathering has this piece from <a href="http://youtu.be/lgIpytx51E8?t=8m42s">Bishop Hanson</a>. There was a strong anti-bullying theme to the Gathering which was a masterful way to get the broader issues of justice and peacemaking to make sene to high school youth.

</p>
<p>
I was bullied as a kid and it still hurts, I wish I would have heard this message in middle school and I hope and pray that the 28,000 young people take this message home with them and change our culture. That's not hyperbole that's possible.

</p>
<p>
Bullying is about those that have power lording it over those who don't. It is a justice issue. It often involves violence. It is a peacemaking issue.

</p>
<p>
The most beautful moment of the Gathering was before it even opened. We had a service of Holden Evening Prayer in one of the club rooms of the dome. It was a small group, maybe 50 people. Rachel Kurtz sang her verison of Hallelujah which is amazing. You should <a href="http://rachelkurtz.com/music/">buy it right now</a>.

</p>
<p>
No I'm serious stop reading go buy it listen to it and then imagine that acoustic in a room of stressed out youth workers ready to embark on what is for many of us the biggest thing we do.

</p>
<p>
Now imagine it in a dome with 33,000 people and baloons lifiting fabric and lights. Can't imagine it, no worries you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPPlZayM3Y&amp;list=UU1sKuNYFiFT5lPKDPXfFcdA&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plcp">don't have to</a>.

</p>
<p>
I also celebrated my 32nd birthday on Thursday. It's been the most difficult year of my life. While I couldn't be with my family who have so strengthened me I was with some of my oldest and best friends. It's not a turning point, every day is an opportunity to walk closer to the way God intends you to be. But it was pretty fucking awsome.

</p>
<p>
Dozens, maybe hundreds of youth have posted that this was "the best week ever!!![](:))" My hope, this is the best week ever - until next week.
