  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For the past week I&#8217;ve been in New Orleans for the 2012 <span class="caps">ELCA</span> Youth Gathering.</p><p>I was part of a team of four other exceptional people and had a great time. I&#8217;ve done five other gatherings, but this one was by far the most impactful from my point of view.</p><p>For me, the heart of the gathering has this piece from <a href="http://youtu.be/lgIpytx51E8?t=8m42s">Bishop Hanson</a>. There was a strong anti-bullying theme to the Gathering which was a masterful way to get the broader issues of justice and peacemaking to make sene to high school youth.</p><p>I was bullied as a kid and it still hurts, I wish I would have heard this message in middle school and I hope and pray that the 28,000 young people take this message home with them and change our culture. That&#8217;s not hyperbole that&#8217;s possible.</p><p>Bullying is about those that have power lording it over those who don&#8217;t. It is a justice issue. It often involves violence. It is a peacemaking issue.</p><p>The most beautful moment of the Gathering was before it even opened. We had a service of Holden Evening Prayer in one of the club rooms of the dome. It was a small group, maybe 50 people. Rachel Kurtz sang her verison of Hallelujah which is amazing. You should <a href="http://rachelkurtz.com/music/">buy it right now</a>.</p><p>No I&#8217;m serious stop reading go buy it listen to it and then imagine that acoustic in a room of stressed out youth workers ready to embark on what is for many of us the biggest thing we do.</p><p>Now imagine it in a dome with 33,000 people and baloons lifiting fabric and lights. Can&#8217;t imagine it, no worries you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPPlZayM3Y&amp;list=UU1sKuNYFiFT5lPKDPXfFcdA&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plcp">don&#8217;t have to</a>.</p><p>I also celebrated my 32nd birthday on Thursday. It&#8217;s been the most difficult year of my life. While I couldn&#8217;t be with my family who have so strengthened me I was with some of my oldest and best friends. It&#8217;s not a turning point, every day is an opportunity to walk closer to the way God intends you to be. But it was pretty fucking awsome.</p><p>Dozens, maybe hundreds of youth have posted that this was &#8220;the best week ever!!!:)!&#8221; My hope, this is the best week ever &#8211; until next week.</p>
