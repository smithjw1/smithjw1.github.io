    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The Marginal Value of Project Management</h1>
    
  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This concept was conceived while I was mowing my lawn. Mowing provides a time to think. Mostly I think about how I don&#8217;t like mowing my lawn, but today I thought about project management.</p><p>First let me say I&#8217;m talking about project management as a function, not about any of the talented Project Managers I work with now or worked with in the past. And I&#8217;m talking about project mangement as a separate function on a project. Yes every project needs &#8220;managed&#8221; in the sense that every project has to be defined, milestones along the way have to be planned and something has to be delivered.</p><p>The question I&#8217;m considering is when is it appropriate to separate out the PM function and have it handled by a specific person otherwise uninvolved in the project. The following chart summarizes my thinking</p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><img alt="Marginal-value-of-pm" height="229" src="/images/12944147-marginal-value-of-pm.png" width="300" /></div><p></p><p>&#8220;Person Days&#8221; is the number of people on a project times the number of days a project is open. The chart shows that the fewer days a project is open or people working on it, separating the project management function has negative marginal value. In other words, it hurts the project.</p><p>Now if this were an economics class with <a href="http://www.econ.psu.edu/~dmateer/">Dr. G. Dirk Mateer</a> I would be done with my essay and out the door, but I&#8217;ll ellaborate a bit more. This is going to seem like I&#8217;m going far afield but stick with me.</p><p>I volunteer at the <span class="caps">ELCA</span> Youth Gathering. One part of the gathering is staffed by volunteers who work in one of the dozens of hotels where participants are housed during the event. For a time, each hotel had a three person team with specific titles: Hotel Pastor, Crisis Counselor and Youth. That model has been done away with for a number of reasons, but one was the fact that Crisis Counselors created crisises.</p><p>When you give someone a job they do it. When you tell someone to manage the project they do, even when the project doesn&#8217;t need external management.</p><p>You can see that there are no numbers on either axis. My thought on the X-axis is that somewhere around 150 person days (five people working for a month) is where the red line turns into the positive. That&#8217;s more than five people working on a project that is open for more than a month.</p><p>Anything less than that and project management shouldn&#8217;t be separated out, but can be done by the team working on the project. This comes from my seven years of experience working on projects in an agency environment.</p><p>What is your experience? Am I wrong? Is the X-intercept too far out? Too close? Let me know in the comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>
