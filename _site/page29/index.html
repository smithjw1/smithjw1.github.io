I am firmly of the opinion that a major failure of organizations of any size is too much care for others work. I'm not as good as others at their job and they aren't as good at mine. When we take time to do others work or make their decisions we rob ourselves and our organizations.

As I've mentioned before I'm a proponent of much of 37Signals ideas about business, one their mantras is: planning is guessing. Which, if you read further, doesn't mean you never plan it means you don't plan too far out.

	      We were talking around the lunch table at work last week and it was decided that a number of us need to write more. I figured it would be motivation if for every week you didn’t write you had to donate $2 to charity.
