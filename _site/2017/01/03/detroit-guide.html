    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Detroit Guide</h1>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently had a conversation about Detroit. I know it’s very hipster to say good things about Detroit, but I had a great time there last summer. Far from a city guide, here were my favorite places in the city.</p>

<h2 id="mercury-buger-bar"><a href="http://mercuryburgerbar.com/">Mercury Buger Bar</a></h2>
<p>So nice we ate here twice.Amazing burgers, great beer selection. And if you are going paleo they will but your meat in a bowl. Outdoor seating in the summer is also quite nice.</p>

<h2 id="grand-trunk-pub"><a href="http://www.grandtrunk.pub/">Grand Trunk Pub</a></h2>
<p>My cousin took me here for my very first meal in Detroit. I have returned many times. Absolutely amazing beer selection. I had <a href="https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/goose-island-bourbon-county-stout/8909/">Bourbon County Stout</a> on tap there, amazing.</p>

<h2 id="the-whisky-parlor"><a href="http://www.whiskyparlor.com/">The Whisky Parlor</a></h2>
<p>Proud to say we were there for opening night. I had my first Japanese scotch. Unfortunately it was after a few other ones so I don’t recall the name.</p>

<h2 id="bucharest-grill"><a href="http://www.bucharestgrill.com/">Bucharest Grill</a></h2>
<p>Cheap big shawarma in a no nonsense bar. If you want a bunch of perfectly grilled meat and a Detroit Brewing lager this is your place.</p>

<h2 id="shinola"><a href="https://www.shinola.com/">Shinola</a></h2>
<p>I got my watch there. I think it’s important for a man to have a watch that will be passed down to his kids. It’s not Swiss or gold, but it is special.</p>

<h2 id="city-market-detroit"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/citymarketdetroit/">City Market Detroit</a></h2>
<p>Sorry for the Facebook link, but their website is down. This place was a lifesaver, a great grocery store in walking distance of downtown. I spent most of my time in the beer isle where I was able to get <a href="https://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/christmas-ale">Great Lakes Christmas</a> in January, which is just unheard of. I also picked up a bottle of <a href="http://twojames.com/our-spirits/">Two James, Grass Widow Bourbon</a>. It’s still mostly corn, but higher than usually rye make this a winner.</p>

<p>So apparently all I did in Detroit was eat and drink whiskey. Rest assured it was outside of the hours of the event I was there for. If you know what I mean, you know what I mean.</p>
