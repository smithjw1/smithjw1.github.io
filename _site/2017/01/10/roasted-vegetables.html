    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Roasted Vegetables</h1>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I didn’t grow up liking brussel sprouts. I don’t know many people that did. In fact we didn’t even really have them at my house, because my parents didn’t like them. Multi-generational brussel sprout trauma is real.</p>

<p>Then one magical Thanksgiving I had roasted brussel sprouts. But not just brussel sprouts, beets, carrots, onion, and garlic as well. All roasted in the oven.</p>

<p>Since then roasted root vegetables has been my go-to potluck veggie dish. It’s simple - I only season with olive oil, salt, and pepper. It’s easy to be seasonal - root vegetables have a long season. And it’s actually pretty darn good for you.</p>

<p>Since that first time I’ve upped my game by adding parsnips, which are especially lovely when roasted. I’ve also started throwing the left overs into a food processor and making a spread. If you go that way, throw in some fresh garlic or rosemary as the sweetness of the roasted veggies can take over.</p>

<p>You set your oven to 400 degrees and peel and chop the beets. Toss in a bit of oil and salt, then when the oven gets up to temp roast just the beets on their own for about 20-30 minutes. Otherwise everything  you have will be beet colored and the beets will be underdone. During that first 30 chop everything else up. I don’t peel the carrots or parsnip and if the sprouts are big I chop them in half. Big chop on the onions as well and the garlic I throw in whole. Toss everything with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper and pop in with the beets for another 30-40 minutes.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid if things start to look crispy around the edges, that’s how it’s supposed to be. A silicon pad on the sheet pan is ideal, but foil is always a good idea for easy clean up. Leftovers aren’t quite as good, but heat up in the oven, the microwave will kill the texture.</p>
