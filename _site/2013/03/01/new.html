  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>New has a life of its own. New opportunities, new relationships, new seasons. The Sounder&#8217;s soccer season started last Saturday with a relatively meaningless game, which they lost.</p>
<p>But I was just as excited about that game as I was about the playoff game that ended last season. It&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>Talking with clients they are always interested in doing new things, not as interested in grinding out the old things.</p>
<p>There is this phase of new relationships, friendships what have you, that is damn exciting. Even when relationships go through a &#8220;phase change&#8221; things get interesting.</p>
<p>The new the novel, is something that our brains seek out. It&#8217;s chemistry, it&#8217;s biology. It&#8217;s silly. It&#8217;s inescapable.</p>
<p>We also retreat to the familiar. Everyone has a newness threshold where we go from exhilarated to exhausted. Peaked attention to overstimulated.</p>
<p>Learning to enjoy and embrace the new things in the brief window where they are new is something I&#8217;ve learned a lot about in the past year. With so many new experiences I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of practice enjoying the new.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m always drawn back to balance, and I don&#8217;t know why. I think my Christian culture really has ingrained the &#8220;everything in moderation&#8221; vibe that calls me away from wherever I&#8217;m headed to middle ground.</p>
