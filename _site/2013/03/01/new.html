  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>New has a life of its own. New opportunities, new relationships, new seasons. The Sounder’s soccer season started last Saturday with a relatively meaningless game, which they lost.</p>

<p>But I was just as excited about that game as I was about the playoff game that ended last season. It’s new.</p>

<p>Talking with clients they are always interested in doing new things, not as interested in grinding out the old things.</p>

<p>There is this phase of new relationships, friendships what have you, that is damn exciting. Even when relationships go through a “phase change” things get interesting.</p>

<p>The new the novel, is something that our brains seek out. It’s chemistry, it’s biology. It’s silly. It’s inescapable.</p>

<p>We also retreat to the familiar. Everyone has a newness threshold where we go from exhilarated to exhausted. Peaked attention to overstimulated.</p>

<p>Learning to enjoy and embrace the new things in the brief window where they are new is something I’ve learned a lot about in the past year. With so many new experiences I’ve gotten a lot of practice enjoying the new.</p>

<p>But I’m always drawn back to balance, and I don’t know why. I think my Christian culture really has ingrained the “everything in moderation” vibe that calls me away from wherever I’m headed to middle ground.</p>
