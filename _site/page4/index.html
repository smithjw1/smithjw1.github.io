	      Christina loves to ski and I love her, so knowing that I am going to fall repeatedly over a weekend is worth it. Nordic skiing isn’t a thing where I’m from. Downhill is relegated to what most Seattle folks would call a bunny slope. But I’ve fond gliding on a pair of skis through a winter postcard wonderland is a uniquely Seattle experience for me. Something I’m excited to share.

	      I recently had a conversation about Detroit. I know it’s very hipster to say good things about Detroit, but I had a great time there last summer. Far from a city guide, here were my favorite places in the city.

	      Having a dog in your life means picking up shit, there are no two ways around that. It’s the great equalizer of pet ownership. What isn’t equal is the distance you carry it on any given day. And for me, the dawn of garbage day means the least amount of time I shuttle crap.

	      This week we discuss an article from the New York Times about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/middleeast/worldvision-palestinians-sponsor-a-child.html">child sponsorship</a>. The author of the article tracked down a sponsored child for a man in Australia. While the child’s community had seen benefit, the child and his family weren’t aware that someone half-a-world away had been sending money for more than a decade to World Vision to help the child.
