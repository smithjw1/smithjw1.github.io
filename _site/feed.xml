        <title>The Two Strangers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a collection focusing on creating non-European centric homebrew content for D&amp;amp;D 5e. You can see all the posts related to this &lt;a href=&quot;/out-of-europe/&quot;&gt;topic here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my research at my local library and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000118600117&quot;&gt;Yes and No: The Intimate Folklore on Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out the text is in the public domain, so it’s a great source to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was written by Alta Jablow, a professor of anthropology at Brooklyn College. Jablow taught there from 1947 until 1980. The first section of the book is a collection of dilemma tales: short stories that leave an unresolved question for the reader to ponder. One of these tales is about two traveling strangers. The book doesn’t place this story, but a bit of searching located &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone&quot;&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt; as it’s place of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two strangers enter a village as night is falling and they are offered a place to rest and some food. What good fortune? Then the chief tells them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But know that in this village there is a custom of long standing. Strangers may sleep here, but on pain of death they may not snore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two settle down to sleep and one stranger begins to snore. The villagers sharpen their knives. The other traveler, thinking quickly, starts singing a song above the snoring. The villagers take up the song and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All that night one stranger snored, one stranger sang, and the townspeople danced and played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The villagers present the two strangers with money on their way out of town to thank them for the night of song and dance. The dilemma ends asking: “How should the strangers split the money?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of finding good lodging and a meal for free and then being told, “But, uh one thing, if you snore we will kill you.” Sounds very much at home in a D&amp;amp;D campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s set up some mechanics for this encounter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing’s first, you have to figure out who in the party snores. Probably better to establish this early in the campaign. Introduce it as a way to make long rests a bit more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could simply ask people to self identify, but if no one offers themselves up as a snorer, you can use this stat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An estimated 45 percent of adults snore occasionally, while 25 percent snore regularly—often disturbing their bed partner’s slumber and possibly their own, too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/why-do-people-snore-answers-for-better-health&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have folks roll a d20 and on a five or less they snore enough to wake the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at the start of each long rest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have the snorers roll a performance check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the rest of the party a charisma saving throw&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anyone who’s save meets or beats the performance check sleeps through it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anyone who fails, by five or less, wakes up briefly to no effect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anyone who fails by more than five, rolls a hit die, and starts the day less that HP from lost sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when the party rolls up on this village the mechanic get’s a twist. The DM rolls a perception check for the villagers. If they catch a snorer the party has 30 seconds to try to figure out what to do. That is, of course, if any of them are awake!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Maiden Nsia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in what will be a collection focusing on creating non-European centric homebrew content for D&amp;amp;D 5e. You can see all the posts related to this &lt;a href=&quot;/out-of-europe/&quot;&gt;topic here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my research at my local library and came up with a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000118600117&quot;&gt;Yes and No: The Intimate Folklore on Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out the text is in the public domain, so it’s a great source to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was written by Alta Jablow, a professor of anthropology at Brooklyn College. Jablow taught there from 1947 until 1980. The first section of the book is a collection of dilemma tales: short stories that leave an unresolved question for the reader to ponder. One of these tales is about the Maiden of Nsia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three friends from &lt;a href=&quot;(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondoukou)&quot;&gt;Bontuku&lt;/a&gt;, a city in the Ivory Coast on the Ghanian border, all love the same woman. She tells them that they have not proven themselves and they must do so before she will choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three friends journey over 400km to the Cape Coast in Ghania. They work to prove themselves, until they find out that the woman they loved is dead. They travel home and bring her back from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do this by each using a magical item they received from their ancestors. The dilemma is which of the three showed the greatest deed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m purposely glossing over details so you will go off and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000118600117?urlappend=%3Bseq=55%3Bownerid=13510798896705935-59&quot;&gt;read the original&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see three ways to use this dilemma in your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-a-puzzle&quot;&gt;As a Puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have an NPC tell the story and ask the PCs to respond to the dilemma. This is a great role play opportunity. There is no “right” answer so you have a lot of freedom as the DM to shape the next part of the story based on their play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-an-adventure-hook&quot;&gt;As an Adventure Hook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a novel way to start a campaign! A few party members are in love with someone who tells them to go and make a name for themselves. They pick up the rest of the party on the way out of town, Merry and Pippen style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have them gain a few levels on the way to and inside a somewhat distant city where adventure. Now th party is well and in their classes and you kill the object of their affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediate stakes, immediate surprise. The game is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-magical-items&quot;&gt;As Magical Items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve left the obvious for last, the magical items the young men have, are a great way to flavor existing spells. Way better than a wand or a staff with charges. From Yes or No:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There were once three friends, youths from Bontuku, and each of them had been given certain wonderful magic properties by their ancestors. One had a mirror in which he could see any person or place that he wished. Another of the young men possessed a fan of magic feathers. If the fan were held aloft it would transport him instantly anywhere he wished to go. The third youth had a wonderful cow-tail switch. He had only to wave it thrice over someone who had died, and it would cause him to be revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we turn those into three magical objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-mirror-of-bontuku&quot;&gt;The Mirror of Bontuku&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this mirror to cast the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying&quot;&gt;Scrying&lt;/a&gt; spell with the following modifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can only be used to see (not hear) the target&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have firsthand knowledge of the target&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no modifications to the target’s wisdom saving throw, they roll it with no bonus or penalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this item a number of times per long rest equal to one-half of your proficiency bonus, rounded down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fan-of-bontuku&quot;&gt;The Fan of Bontuku&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this fan to cast the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleport&quot;&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; spell with the following modification: to be transported, creatures have to hold on to you. Every creature you transport must make a strength saving throw. The DC is equal to 5 times the number of additional creatures. On a failure the caster can choose to complete the transport or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this item a number of times per long rest equal to one-half of your proficiency bonus, rounded down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-switch-of-bontuku&quot;&gt;The Switch of Bontuku&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wave this cow-tail switch three times over a dead creature and it casts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify&quot;&gt;Revivify&lt;/a&gt; spell. You do not need additional material components. This item can be used once per long rest. Once used it can be recharged by conducting a 10-minute ritual and expending a third-level or higher spell spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to ballance these objects, but all of them are fairly high level. So you could certainly power them up or down.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;bryce&quot;&gt;Bryce&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coin is there again. As I turn the coin over all of reality chages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tails, I’m wearing a mail shirt holding a flail that ended not with a sphere but with a cube. Dice markings pounded into the dark steel. The proper weapon for a warrior of Tymora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the heads side it up, I’m in my novice robes and the smell and sounds of a feast filter through the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heads feels like the end, and tails feels like I can continue to fight. I have chosen to fight many, many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first facing one dark cleric, unable to beseech help from Tymora I thought myself cast into the doom. Swinging this unfamiliar weapon clumsily and tripping over my mail I was easy work for the cleric. The first dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then things became better, I was able to hold my own. Still returning to my cell after each death, but knowing that I was being tested. Forged anew as a true warrior of Tymora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I defeated the one cleric, the second appeared. Suddenly I knew they were undead and Tymora heard me again and I was able to harness her light to make them flee from me, but not always. Dozens more battles, dozens of deaths. Maybe hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then luck. I called on Tymora and one burst into flames while the other tried to flee. I was finally able to move and swing the flail with ease. I backed the dark cleric into a corner and swung again and again until he fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I faced him. Lord Rudain. That was hundreds of battles ago. I’ve grown stronger, though less nimble. At first I could barely dent his armor, but with time, I’ve drawn blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve still never bested him, and each time his mace crushes my skull I end up right back here, ready to flip the coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use my rage to flip right away, sometimes I pray and contemplate. This time has been the longest. I have read through my prayer book at least a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used this time to train to make myself a mighty warrior for her cause. If she calls be back to earth I will stamp out the darkness. I will pound any follower of Beshaba until they are dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps my journey is through. Perhaps I can finally rest and meet my family, all my family. I toss the coin into the air once more and smile as it spins high, content in my choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently playing through a campaign DM’d by the indomitable &lt;a href=&quot;http://erikmaxwell.co/&quot;&gt;Erik Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;. As a writing exercise I’m giving myself 30 minutes to recap our weekly adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tough one, first time a character I created dies. I had a good bit more to explore with Bryce, but this helps to end his story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;thenardier&quot;&gt;Thenardier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no tracker, but you don’t have to be to follow the rut marks of that cart. I was about 1/4 mile behind them when all of a sudden the ruts stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn’t turn off, the just stopped, as did all the footprints in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ranger is indeed among them I thought as I sped my rescently stolen horse to a trot. No need to go slow now, either I’ll never find them or I’ll run right into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two miles down the road I could have sworn that I heard the creak of a cart wheel, but it could have been the wind. This was not my terrain and the sooner I got back into a town the safer I would feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m on the road, I’m dressed as a nobleman. Better to be prey and lure in the predator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recalled the day when I first met Bryce. Only he didn’t call himself that at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get wind of petty coups in my line of work. Always a good time to make a few coins. It’s also the ony thing that would drag me as far North as Vestygg. I was on my way out of town as the old Lord was being lead to the stockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then ahead of me, in the trees, a portal opened and something came tumbling out. With just a satchel the boy priest landed in a heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m luring in highwaymen, traveling alone is my usual mode, but traveling with a priest has its advantages. He kept to the trees, but stealthy he was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped my horse and yelled out, “No need to hide priest. In fact, I could use some prayers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a priest, a sea captain peered around the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No priest here.” brogued from the captain’s lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a casual hearer, this mimicry would pass muster, but I know what I’m seeing and I know how the Lady’s servants work. You study one side of a coin long enough, you are bound to pick up something about the obverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh well then ahoy captain, won’t you walk with me?” I questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear can’t be disguised. This boy was out of his depth. He sauntered, or attempted to saunter down the slope and seemed happy to have the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode and talked, he told me of his ship: The Seaboard. It had a mast, and sails, and beyond that not much detail. And of Vestygg he couldn’t describe much more than what you can see from the chapel near the Market gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the time past he hardly noticed that he no longer looked like the sea captain, but still was affecting the accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see the sea, she is, a cruel mistress, she is.” he opined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As cruel as Tymora?” I barbed. And he took the bait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Lady is not cruel,” he said as he pointed a finger at me. A finger attached to an arm no longer adorned with the fine robe of the sea captain, but of the simple cloak of a priest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never heard his whole story, but he did admit to being a novice from Vestygg, it was about then we were robbed, right on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking like easy pickings is actually fairly easy. These were the type that ride along with you for a while to size you up and get you when you aren’t looking. This time it was at dinner that I found myself with a knife to my throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had let it happen, and I was ready to break free when I was blinded by golden flames that burned the hat right off my attacker. He fled into the night, tunic smoldering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Bryce had no idea what he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I, I, just asked the Lady to protect you,” he stammered, “I never meant to hurt anyone!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Lady works in mysterious ways.” I lied. It is true that gods are fickle but my experience is Tymora tends to protect with deception not with fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My young friend must be holding some hurt, some anger. Something that makes his prayers have urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently playing through a campaign DM’d by the indomitable &lt;a href=&quot;http://erikmaxwell.co/&quot;&gt;Erik Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;. As a writing exercise I’m giving myself 30 minutes to recap our weekly adventures. I’m starting to write a parallel story focused on Thenardier, a Rouge Mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;thenardier&quot;&gt;Thenardier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to Martin’s place the windows were darkened. I was in a hurry to get out of town as I had already sold my spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love working the South. No one wonders why I’m walking around with uncut diamonds worth a few thousand gold in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at Martin’s to pay him his cut. If you are going to work a game, always better to have the owner on your side. Martin prefers to take this shady business around back. As I walked around to the alley, a bleeding, burnt, Hunter stormed through Martin’s back door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, so it appears as if someone got to the bounty hunters first. This fellow looked pissed, so I just hung around outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you know they had a caster!,” the half-orc bellowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keep it down Oban, you’ll wake the misses,” hissed Martin in reply. “No, of course not, a caster?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are all dead, three half-orcs. I saw Zargoz cut down by a beam of light, there was no blood, no blood, no blood.” Oban repeated as his voice trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin was smart enough not to say anything. An angry half-orc is not one to be trifled with. I thought I heard something like a cry but more like a moan and then Martin came flying into the alley landing in a heap next in the gutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oban notched an arrow and held it to the back of Matin’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ll pay for their deaths in blood dwarf!” the mercenary snarled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, normally I would consider this a fortuitous event. With Martin dead, I could keep his cut. And there would be one less person alive who knew me. Well not really me. Martin thought I was a courier for a big wig in Halesport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth was I was the bigwig too. I had been writing to Martin as Freidiah, the owner of The Bearded Lady, a brothel and gambling house in Halesport. I told him I knew a card shark that was looking for a game to take, and if he was willing to get this shark into the game, he would get a cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am never myself. With each encounter I invent a new identity. No one sees me twice. In fact the fence that bought the spells thinks I’m Martin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, like I said, Martin dead was mostly upside to me, but the fact that the half-orc was here meant the $50,000 gold reward was still up for grabs. And the fact that this Hunter couldn’t tell the difference between a caster and a cleric meant that I knew more than Martin or Oban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s not a caster, he follows the Lady.” I offered, slinking from the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I expected the bow was turned on me, but my disguise added a few inches of padding and I had a few tricks up my sleave so I wasn’t worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, by all means keep that bow pointed at Martin, my master would let me pocket his cut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gambit was right. The bounty hunter was worried about his friends, but more worried about his money. With that, the half-orc lowered his bow, Martin got to his feet and ushered us back inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oban, still spitting with rage and grief said, “Talk fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can’t say I’m one for fast talk, fast women maybe, but not fast talk.” I drawled. “But it’s easy to mistake a cleric for a caster. It looks the same, but the power comes from a different place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well this one moved himself from inside to outside in a second. And when I ran through him, he shattered into pieces.” Oban grumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Certainly a worshiper of the Lady then.” I replied, “She grants all sorts of favors to those that follow her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So they still live?” I continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aye, I left them right where we followed them to. I can’t go back in there alone, it’s not worth $50,000 gold pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t forget about my cut,” Martin jumped back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both I and the half-orc turned our gaze to him, and he shrank from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said to Martin, “Our mutual friend told me about the cleric.” “He also told me that those halflings blew your bar to bits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this Oban chuckled. “Indeed they did. We were waiting outside like you asked when the Prince stepped out of the door, just for a second before he got blown back inside. The blast nearly ripped the whole side of the building.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was any color left in Martin’s face it drained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you get for letting halflings trade various and sundry in your bar.” I quiped. Turning to Oban I said, “Where did you leave them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I counted out the few gold I owed Martin as Oban described the storehouse where they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t imagine they are still there, and if they are, I doubt you could take them,” Oban said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I ride for Halesport tonight, but if you keep an eye on them and send a raven to the Bearded Lady in Halesport, Freidiah will send you the firepower you need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slipped into the night and left them to haggle. I might still get lucky and Martin might get killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to walk towards the storehouse. I was going to head out of town, but now I had something far more interesting to tend too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I too follow a Lady. I’m not a cleric, too much groveling. But I do bring misfortune, and I was looking forward to visiting misfortune on these adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I was in trouble when four people walked through the fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been casing this game for weeks. High stakes, spells as currency, and very exclusive. You had to be a dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took quite a bit of persuasion to get the potion I had been using. For the past week, I had choked down the smell stuff, walked into a dwarf bar and lost money. I only had two vile vials left when I got the invite to the game at the Hound’s Tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally it was my night. I got to the Hound’s Tooth early. Early enough to see the three little-folk arrive conspicuously separately. It takes a con to know a con. These three were working together, but seemed small time, unlikely to disrupt my play. If anything a little ruckus at the right time would help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then a knight and three half-elves come strolling into the bar. Not through the front door mind you, but from the fireplace. And not just any knight. A knight with a 50,000 gold piece price on his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a different game to play tonight, but once I cleaned these dwarfs out, I could probably make some quick money on my way out of town. Any bounty hunter in 100 miles would pay handsomely for the whereabouts of these four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheating is easy when you are actually a foot taller than you appear to be. My marks have no idea I can see their cards quite clearly from up in the rafters. That’s all the advantage I need to start cleaning up. I just need a bit longer when I feel the potion wearing off. I need a distraction, and if on queue a table flips over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, just the ruckus I need to quickly down another slug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then it gets to be just a bit too much rukus. The dwarf swings his wand towards the halfling circling behind the table we all duck, but I can’t get under the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jarl Shueniff tries to shove my head down, but instead he pushes my back and my chest bounces of the edge of the table and he knows something is up. I draw my dagger to make sure he never figures it out when suddenly I’m not worried about it anymore, and it appears neither is he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A halfling has an arrow through his hand and the knight is screaming at some girl, but I’m quite calm and ready to get back to the game. The darkly dressed half-elf starts a tune. A halfling is run through behind me and I get my feet out of the way. Despite all this I am feeling calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the priest throws some holy water in the air and suddenly I remember that I may have to kill Shueniff. That thought is quickly forgotten when a massive human hurtles towards us. This human missile turns the third member of the halfling tro into pink mist before throwing the table into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shueniff seems to have bigger worries than me and he and the others leave the smoldering remains of the tavern. The four travelers pay no mind to me as I pick up the discarded spells. An even bigger night than I had planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t overstay my welcome and leave just in time to hear a darkly cloaked, drunk dwarf talk of a safe house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think these four have an idea what they have gotten themselves into. They would be better off walking back through that fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve helped kill an Inquisitor. Twice. I’ve helped kill Rudainia Soldiers. I’ve helped kill street urchins. I’ve fought on the side of slavers against those who would set slaves free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But along the way I have stopped a servant of Beshaba and experienced the glory of the Lady in my presence. She has honored us with her words and encouraged us on our quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bastard’s bastard from a forgotten corner of Norgaard. I am the Lady’s chosen servant. I’m barely a man in human terms and hardly a boy in elf terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am between two worlds, two continents and aligned with powers I can’t possibly understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I not paralyzed by fear and doubt? It is only in my zealous belief that this quest is from Tymora herself that I can go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no time for doubt only time for action. I must move this story forward and know that the time for timidity is over. I am not a boy hunting deer in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My companions can do amazing and and terrible things with their weapons. I must do amazing and terrible things with the power of the Lady so that all may recognize me as her servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be only boldness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dear Pennsylvania</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Vote. Especially if you live in Pennsylvania. If you are registered in Pennsylvania, you should vote in person. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-at-a-Polling-Place.aspx&quot;&gt;find a polling place here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need help getting to the your polling place, call someone. If you are registered with a political party, call your county party office. They want you to vote and will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvanians may decide this election and every vote cast in Pennsylvania matters and should be counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I think you should vote for Joe Biden for President. I did. This is the first time I’ve supported a Democrat for President. I worked for &lt;a href=&quot;https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/27054/rick-santorum&quot;&gt;Senator Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt;. I interned at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/about-heritage/mission&quot;&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/about/&quot;&gt;Commonwealth Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I went to Grove &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gcc.edu/Home/Our-Story/Faith-Freedom&quot;&gt;City College&lt;/a&gt;. I am not a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 25, 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-ukraine-call-transcript-read-the-document&quot;&gt;President Trump had a phone call with the President of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The President of the United States asked a foreign leader to investigate his opponent. This is not acceptable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if your kid, or niece, told you they asked some kids from the next town over to dig up dirt on the person they were running against for Class President. Would you be excited about that? Would that be behavior you encourage or discourage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect more from the President of the United States. I think you should as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;bryce&quot;&gt;Bryce&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wolf was the chief. The beast who made short work of two villagers before our eyes was the very man sworn to protect this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have we walked into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wanted us to protect this village, all the while he was hunting it? He needed us to stand up to a few dozen men, when he could turn into a fire breathing, ten foot tall, wolf?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something is not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our trade at the chapel in Vestygg was merchants barely getting through the door, tossing their coins into the basked my father had invented, and moving on. Our coffer basked took the time to ask the Lady’s favor from minutes to seconds, and the donations poured in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all a volume business. There were the confessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inaction is the only sin in the worship of the Lady. Moral codes of absolute right and wrong rarely work in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, one of Pelor’s sunnies can do ethical summersaults to prove that a woman is justified to steal bread to feed her starving children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ask the same summer priests what that same woman should do if she can only steal one loaf, but has two children and they freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can a god tell someone there is a right choice in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell her to break the loaf in half, and ask Tymora to be kind. Luck and chance sustain when goodness and mercy can not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penitent would come to our chapel and confess their indecision. The Abbott would listen, and nod, and tell them what to do. Sometimes it was his best judgement, sometimes it was what they wanted to hear so he could go back to the tavern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when someone was droning on for particularity long, and wasn’t keping the coppers dropping in the coffer, the Abbot would excuse himself come to my cell, and ask me to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is why the first bit of wisdom he taught me was how to have the Lady transform me into someone else. It’s also why he taught me how to mimic voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would ask the Lady to make me look like the Abbott, check the mirror and walk back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from a burden, these encounters were my only contact with the outside world. I would revel in the details. My aim was to ask the question that unlocked their indecision – like a key turning a bolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how I knew something was wrong in this village. Why would only one specific hut, not on the edge of the village be attacked? Why one boy, but not another, why now? Who in the village could leave unseen when everyone shares their tent with others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked Shaba about that, she barely understood why. The chief is the only one that could come and go as he pleased, and apparently his pleasure was to hunt his kith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I have never been cold. When you grow up sharing a monk’s cell, even a small oil lamp will keep you warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall, my father and I hunted for the deer that would keep us fed through the winter. Leaving before first light I could often see my breath, but I wasn’t cold. I was free. We would stay in the woods all day, butchering anything we would take, and wrapping it in paper so we could smuggle it back in after dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were long days, but not cold days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know cold now. As we trudge towards the village, the the stinging salt spray quickly coats my robes. If this place doesn’t give us shelter, we won’t make it through the day, let alone the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard of these islands of the far north, isolated, just the way the elves like it. Fortunately Kirrix and Elros speak elvish and secure us freedom to enter the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bargain for cloaks, but the reality is I would have given the coin from my forehead for the warmth these cloaks provide. Lady forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly the next hour is a blur, we trudge up to see the leader of this village, tell him our lie, tell him the truth, and he doesn’t slit our throats. That is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I lay down in their infirmary I feel some measure of warmth. As I see the others fall off to sleep, I pull out the lockbox we found in the temple. I want desperately to hear that tune again, but I have on idea if opening the box here wil make the entire structure collapse around us. And I’m too tired to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awaken to the chief telling us that few will stay and fight, and that blurry hour comes back to me. We’ve agreed to help this village fend off Lady Sky’s enforcers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m wanted in Ostia and Rudainia, why not add Kaldygg to the list! I have no more home, and Lady Sky is a tyrant. Let’s see what luck the true Lady can bring this village at the icy end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
