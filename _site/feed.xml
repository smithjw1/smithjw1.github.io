        <title>Detroit Guide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation about Detroit. I know it’s very hipster to say good things about Detroit, but I had a great time there last summer. Far from a city guide, here were my favorite places in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mercury-buger-barhttpmercuryburgerbarcom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mercuryburgerbar.com/&quot;&gt;Mercury Buger Bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So nice we ate hear twice. We were going to go to Slows across the street, which I hear is also great. Amazing burgers, great beer selection. And if you are going paleo they will but your meat in a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grand-trunk-pubhttpwwwgrandtrunkpub&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grandtrunk.pub/&quot;&gt;Grand Trunk Pub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin took me here for my very first meal in Detroit. I have returned many times. Absolutely amazing beer selection. I had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/goose-island-bourbon-county-stout/8909/&quot;&gt;Bourbon County Stout&lt;/a&gt; on tap there, amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-whisky-parlorhttpwwwwhiskyparlorcom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whiskyparlor.com/&quot;&gt;The Whisky Parlor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proud to say we were there for opening night. I had my first Japanese scotch. Unfortunatly it was after a few other ones so I don’t recall the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bucharest-grillhttpwwwbucharestgrillcom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bucharestgrill.com/&quot;&gt;Bucharest Grill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap big shawarma in a no nonsense bar. If you want a bunch of perfectly grilled meat and a Detroit Brewing lager this is your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shinolahttpswwwshinolacom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shinola.com/&quot;&gt;Shinola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got “my watch.” there. I think it’s important for a man to have a watch that will be passed down to his kids. It’s not Swiss or gold, but it is special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;city-market-detroithttpswwwfacebookcomcitymarketdetroit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/citymarketdetroit/&quot;&gt;City Market Detroit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the Facebook link, but their website is down. This place was a lifesaver, a great grocery store in walking distance of downtown. I spent most of my time in the beer isle where I was able to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/christmas-ale&quot;&gt;Great Lakes Christmas&lt;/a&gt; in January, which is just unheard of. I also picked up a bottle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://twojames.com/our-spirits/?age-verified=14ef07cdc3&quot;&gt;Two James, Grass Widow Bourbon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still mostly corn, but higher than usually rye make this a winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So apparently all I did in Detroit was eat and drink whiskey. Rest assured it was outside of the hours of the event I was there for. If you know what I mean, you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Get to Know Your Neighbor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This fall my church, Phinney Ridge Lutheran Church, has hosted a series of classes on Islam. It has been exciting to learn know how uninformed I was about Islam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the most recent session the Ph.D. that is teaching used a Muslim children’s book’s to share a story from the Quran. That is perhaps the best way to show where we are all at in our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of fear about Islam or better said about a particular group of people who claim Islam as their reason for the unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my visit to Friday prayers at a local mosque I met those whom many fear. An imam whose dressed the same as the Ayatollah or Osama Bin Laden. Though I’m sure that to someone from Arabia the differences in their dress would be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Imam gave a moving sermon in Arabic. The same language used by ISIS propaganda. Though someone who spoke Arabic would be able to clearly tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people stopped being “these people” and started being father’s and husband’s and sons. Amazingly humble and hospitable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we asked what we might do, they said tell people about us. So, in my small way I am. The people of the Idris Mosque in North Seattle are your neighbors. You should get to know them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Garbage Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a dog in your life means picking up shit, there are no two ways around that. It’s the great equalizer of pet ownership. What isn’t equal is the distance you carry it on any given day. And for me, the dawn of garbage day means the least amount of time I shuttle crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other day a private trash can is off limits. Even if it’s on the curb, even if there are other feces filled bags in there, that’s your trash and I will not trespass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communal dumpsters are another mater. When they are far away from the apartment building and not near overflowing, I feel like they are fair game. Public trash cans in parks are also clearly ok. The small trash cans next to Seattle bus stops are a murky area. In the winter I’m ok using them, but in the summer or if they are near full, I shy away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on garbage day, with your can on the curb, I feel like it’s fine to deposit my bag. But only &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the garbage truck has come by. There are few worse feelings than hauling a can back into your house only to find a lonely, soggy bag of shit at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why it’s soggy, but it always is. It’s probably better that I do not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you see me dropping a bag of shit into your garbage can or dumpster, know that I have thought long and hard about the moral implications of my actions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Now Brought to you by Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been interested in trying out &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that my hosting service needed renewal game me a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part was adding the necessary Ruby Gems. I went the not-cool-but-oh-so-easy route of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; install and all was well. With the exception of having to run the importer as root, which meant that all the posts were owned by root. A simple chown solved that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing a lot more development lately, stuff that doesn’t make sense on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://abravenew.com/blog&quot;&gt;A Brave New Blog&lt;/a&gt; maybe I’ll write some more about that here, no promises.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fracking Truthers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8558485/fracking-water-contamination-pennsylvania-study&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found a small, regulatory permissible amount of toxic chemicals in drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It even goes on to say, that current regulation would have likely prevented this small contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you would expect drilling groups to say: “We told it was safe, this proves it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, they basically deny the whole thing and try to make it seem like the study is a fraud. Why? Because only total acceptance of the fracking’s salvific nature is allowed. Any doubters are charlatans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good study that clearly laid out the dangers of improper procedures and that the whole argument that the chemicals don’t make it into drinking water is bunk. It’s an important study to understand if safe fracking is possible, but instead of celebrating the industry dismisses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this disregard for even &lt;strong&gt;supportive&lt;/strong&gt; but cautious science that makes me continue to seriously doubt the industries good faith.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Brave New</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of you know that I left Masterworks in September. What most of you don’t know is that I’ve been working on a partnership with two longtime colleagues and friends, it’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://abravenew.com&quot;&gt;A Brave New&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how excited and pleased I am to be starting this new company/adventure. It’s the culmination of a lot of work and inspiration. The support of my family, the example of entrepreneurs, the encouragement of teachers and mentors and the fellowship of friends all played a part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’d like to ask you to do one more thing for me: spread the word. A Brave New is ready to help nonprofits and small business tell their story and expand their reach. If that sounds like something someone you know could use, drop an email or a tweet or a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://abravenew.com&quot;&gt;the new website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abravenew&quot;&gt;follow us on twitter&lt;/a&gt; and keep in touch. We are going to have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Great Security Washington State Ferries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t take the ferry nearly as much as I used to, I just got around to turning off email alerts for ferry delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, I needed a password I had long forgot so I sent for a password reset. Here’s the email I received:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/15t.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see the password is redacted, because it was my actual password. I recognized it because I often use a password across a number of accounts that I don’t care about. Password reuse is a security no-no, but it’s quite common and when we are talking about my Washington State Ferry account which holds no personal info beyond an outdated address, I’m not terribly concerned about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is when the password is properly secured. The fact that they could send me my actual password means they are either storing it in plain text or a reversible encryption algorithm. Either way it’s at significantly more risk than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passwords should always be stored using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm&quot;&gt;salted one way encryption scheme&lt;/a&gt;. That way if your database is ever compromised (from inside or outside) only the most common passwords will be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is truly lazy programming to be able to spit back a users password and then to send it via email is downright irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The World Must Turn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up being told that I could trust police officers and that if I was in trouble or lost I could always go to one for help. I can’t imagine a world where that isn’t the case. Problem is I don’t have to imagine it, I’m living in it. Or better put I’m living beside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a person of racial, gender, religious, age, citizenship and class privilege, I don’t live in the same world as many of my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music is very emotional for me and two weeks ago we sang a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiritandsong.com/compositions/30269&quot;&gt;hymn&lt;/a&gt; at church, here’s the third verse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the halls of power to the fortress tower,
not a stone will be left on stone.
Let the king beware for your justice tears
ev’ry tyrant from his throne.
The hungry poor shall weep no more,
for the food they can never earn;
There are tables spread, ev’ry mouth be fed,
for the world is about to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world does not feel like it is turning fast enough, but the chorus of this hymn does let me sing for a hoped for future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My heart shall sing of the day you bring.
Let the fires of your justice burn.
Wipe away all tears, for the dawn draws near,
and the world is about to turn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Take a Chance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently attended my second Creative Mornings and heard this great talk by &lt;a href=&quot;http://hillelcooperman.com/&quot;&gt;Hillel Cooperman&lt;/a&gt; Rated “R” for adult language, but hilarious adult language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://creativemornings.com/talks/embed/hillel-cooperman/1&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t call this a proscriptive talk, but a very personal descriptive exploration of imposter syndrome. Something that as a new entrepreneur I can completely understand.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>There's ... someone on the wing ... some thing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a reasonable nervous flier. By that I mean I understand the fact that riding my bike in the city is more likely to get me hurt than flying. But I also know that it’s an engineering masterpiece that is keeping me up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A British Company has proposed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037709/in-this-airplane-redesign-no-one-and-everyone-gets-a-window-seat&quot;&gt;plane without windows&lt;/a&gt;, instead the whole fuselage is covered in OLEDs and is a giant screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will mean the plane can be lighter with more interior space, saving fuel costs. The question is will people fly in it? The plane is no less safe than it was, but does it feel more like a flying death tube when you loose visual contact with the outside world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a concept for now, but I’m interested in folks reaction. Would you fly in a plane where you couldn’t spot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVxuHqmNpbI&quot;&gt;something on the wing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
