  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve interviewed a fair number of folks in my years. Not just for jobs, but possible vendors as well. We also do interviews as part of our branding process.</p>

<p>I’m in the middle of reading <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/unpersuadables-adventures-with-the-enemies-of-science/oclc/881888141&amp;referer=brief_results">The Unpersuadables</a>, which talks a lot about how our brains are set up to lie to us, even when we are trying to be truthful. This makes interviews problematic. People generally want to present a positive view of themselves and the world, so they are unlikely to admit the negative side of things.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90221337/how-to-phrase-interview-questions-to-get-people-to-tell-the-truth">University of Utah study</a> suggests a tricky phrasing to elicit an honest response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, instead of asking, “Do you ever use work time for personal email or social media?” or “Have you used a sick day when you weren’t actually sick?” VanEpps suggests phrasing your question with the negative assumption. “‘You’ve used a sick day when you weren’t sick, right? Or ‘You use work time for personal email, right?’ ”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did find this only works with common behaviors. Asking something like, “You do steal other employee’s lunches, right?” would be a bridge too far.</p>

<p>This makes some sense, by normalizing the potentially negative behavior you have created space for conversation.</p>

<p>In brand interviews we often ask about negative interactions. Rather than asking, “Can you think of a time where your interactions with Brand X weren’t ideal?” this research would suggest we should ask, “We’ve heard about some not ideal interactions with Brand X, can you tell me one you have had?”</p>

<p>We are social animals. By making the interviewee’s negative actions part of the group, it allows them to be honest.</p>

<p>And the honest truth is we all do some personal emailing at work, have taken sick days because we just wanted a day off, and have had at least one less than ideal interaction with a brand.</p>

<p>In all of those cases an honest answer is always better than a flat denial.</p>
