    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Getting Google Analytics Right</h1>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Google Analytics is the ubiquitous measurement tool of the modern internet. At the amazing price of free, it’s become the defacto standard for website reporting.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t think you use Google Analytics, you probably do. Some developer or agency probably added a property under their account and has a great view into your data.</p>

<p>It used to be that you couldn’t transfer a property from account to account. So if your data was locked into another account you were out of luck. Fortunately that has changed. You can <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6370521">read more</a> in Google’s help documentation.</p>

<p>Having your data in an account you own is just the first step. From there, there are tag management, cross domain tracking, conversion tracking, and utm_parameter conventions to consider.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to dive in and start adding tags and running exports, but first you need a plan. Your organization needs to come to consensus on what will be measured. If you don’t have this up front there will be a meeting six months from now where someone wants a number you can’t produce. That’s not a happy feeling.</p>

<p>We like to base our measurements around the organizational goals and strategies. Roughly it looks like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Goal #1 - Generate more leads</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategy 1 - Have a highly efficient website</p>
  </li>
  <li>Metric 1 - Overall site conversion rate</li>
  <li>
    <p>Metric 2 - Landing page conversion rate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategy 2 - Attract new potential leads</p>
  </li>
  <li>Tactic 1 - LinkedIn Advertising</li>
  <li>Metric 1 - Conversion rate</li>
  <li>Metric 2 - First time visits</li>
</ul>

<p>If you proceed through your organization’s goals, you will end up with a dozen or more metrics. Many are just there out of the box. Some will require setup. And one or two won’t even be available in Google Analytics.</p>

<p>This framework also gives you a clear testing checklist once you implement. You can look at each metric and make sure it’s reporting properly.</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve done all that and you still aren’t sure if your setup is up to snuff. Fear not, dear reader, we have a <a href="https://inbound.abravenew.com/google-analytics-scorecard">scorecard</a> just for you. It will take less than five minutes and allow you to easily get a handle on how you are doing.</p>

<p><a href="https://inbound.abravenew.com/google-analytics-scorecard">Get the scorecard now</a>.</p>

<p>If you aren’t happy with your score, we, of course, are here to help. <a href="https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/jacob41/analytics-check-up">You can book 15-minutes with me</a> to talk things over. Usually there are 1-2 quick wins we can come to in that time.</p>

<p>What’s measured is what’s managed. We want you to be confident you are managing it well.</p>
