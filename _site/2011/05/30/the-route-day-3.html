    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The Route - Day 3</h1>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>
Day three gets us to our third of five states, via lunch in Paw Paw, WV then back to Maryland for Dinner in Hancock and Camping in Fort Frederick State Park.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This seventy-five mile day also sees us onto our third trail the Western Maryland Rail Trail. The WMRT parallels the C&amp;O Canal trail, but is paved, so we'll be able to make better time, and avoid a part of the C&amp;O that is usually rather bad. Word this is the most remote part of the route, and the lack of restaurants that aren't part of an Exxon highlight the fact.

</p>
<p>
Paw Paw, WV has a exactly two options and were going to Grandma's Country Kitchen, the only one with reviews. The canal is the West Virginia Maryland border so we will be a few feet from West Virgina for nearly all of this part of the ride, but only crossing over into the Mountaineer State once on this day.

</p>
<p>
Dinner is slated for Hancock, MD a trail town and the restaurant reviews here are all over the map. Most places get as many raves as pan's but trail guides say that Weaver's Restaurant is the best place to stop so we will.

</p>
<p>
Camping in a state park means it is free, but also first come first serve. I'm fairly sure we won't have trouble, but if the park is full we might have to stealth camp along the trail.
