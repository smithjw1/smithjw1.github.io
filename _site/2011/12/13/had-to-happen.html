  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>If you are part of Steeler&#8217;s nation then you are either shocked or not surpised at all to find out that <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82503f17/article/steelers-lb-harrison-suspended-one-game-for-mccoy-hit?module=HP11_breaking_news">Harrison was suspended</a>.</p><p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the hit, you probably don&#8217;t care to, but there is video in the link above.It clearly shows Harrison droping his helment before contact. The hit has going to be hard, and likley draw a personal foul, but he didn&#8217;t have to lower the crown of his helmet. He didn&#8217;t even attempt to wrap up. It is a picture perfect hit for the <span class="caps">NFL</span> to make an example of.</p><p>The debate about whether that should be legal or not is pointless. The <span class="caps">NFL</span> has made it clear: helmet to helmet hits with intent are no longer part of football. You can call it changing the game if you want, but consider it changed.</p><p>This is the first suspesion for a hit, which had to happen at some point. Even hefty fines aren&#8217;t as much as game checks and what almost every <span class="caps">NFL</span> player truly values is playing the game. Beyond that, teams don&#8217;t care if their players get fined so they have no inscentive to coach away from these kinds of hits.</p><p>The fact that its a Steeler is no surprise to me. They have been so unrepentant individual and as a group about the changes to the rules in the <span class="caps">NFL</span>, it had to be them. They exemplify what the leage office is trying to take out of football.</p><p>As a fan, I&#8217;m not happy, but the Steelers brought this upon themselves. I also wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. I want the team to play the brand of football that is their identify until it is clear that it is hurting their chances of winning.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end I think the suspension is fair because it sends a very clear message. There is no ambiguity now that this has been done. Hit a QB in the head with intent, you&#8217;re out for a game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
