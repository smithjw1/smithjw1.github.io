While on vacation we eat a memorable meal at the <a href="http://www.ligoniertavern.com/Home.aspx">Ligonier Tavern</a>. The best way to describe it is as better than it needed to be.

</p>
<p>
In other words we were in a bar in a small town; if they would have put a nice plate of food in front of us we'd have been happy. But it wasn't just a nice plate of food it was a well loved expression from the chef.

</p>
<p>
He's a transplant from New Zealand via Colorado. I had gnocchi that were soft and perfect. My Dad had scallops that were ok but the risotto with artichokes that came with it was out of this world.

</p>
<p>
Shawn had lamb that was Indian inspired served with rice and flat bread, very authentic to the cuisine.

</p>
<p>
Oh and a very good beer selection to boot.

</p>
<p>
I posted on twitter about this already, but this spot is worth a stop in Ligonier. It is also a great example of a chef putting great food that may be a bit of a reach for the local population but knowing that it is kick ass. I guarantee there wasn't a place in 30 miles serving cold Thai noodle salad, but this place is and is serving it well.
