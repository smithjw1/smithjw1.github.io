    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Free Site Survey Tool</h1>
    
  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="http://www.theagitator.net/communications/new-automated-fundraising-tool-free-forever/">Agitator</a> tipped me off to an interesting free tool from <a href="http://donorfeedback.thedonorvoice.com/">Donor Voice</a>.</p>
<p>This feedback widget allows you to place a customizable survey on your site. We built a similar tool at <a href="http://www.masterworks.com/">Masterworks</a>, but with a different purpose.</p>
<p>The Donor Voice tool is designed to ask someone about their experience once it is complete. The Masterworks tool was designed to gather visitor intent.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor: there is no such thing as a free lunch, and you should expect a sales call from Donor Voice as the cost of using this free service. You are also giving them access to your satisfaction data, certainly helpful in the sales process.</p>
<p>The setup is short and you can be online in a matter of minutes. Partially it is so easy to setup because you don&#8217;t get to choose any of the questions that are part of the survey. The four questions the survey does ask are general enough to work for any organization:</p>
<p><img src="/images/14.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This content is owned by Donor Voice so don&#8217;t steal the questions. Also don&#8217;t worry about the red and black background, those are the customizable parts of the survey.</p>
<p>The automated email was also fairly general, but was responsive to how I filled out the survey. You can only fill out the survey once per IP address, so I had to use a Web Proxy service to see the other responses.</p>
<p>If you fill out the survey with good marks, the response suggests that the constituent donates, without a link to do so.</p>
<p>I think the lack of choices here is a great thing. Constructing surveys is harder than most people think and the constraints mean that organizations won&#8217;t create something bogus.</p>
<p>I believe two simple improvements would make this tool even more effective. The first is to ask the donor if they donated today.</p>
<p>The second is to add one more field to the setup process: donation <span class="caps">URL</span>. The last line of the email when someone responds with good marks says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you please consider donating today in support of our continuing efforts to&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the text &#8220;please consider donating today&#8221; was linked, the email would make that donation a one-click action.</p>
<p>And with that, you can see why asking if the individual donated matters. If I had just given a gift, and it wasn&#8217;t acknowledged by this email, it would most likely diminish donor loyalty. The very thing the survey is trying to measure and increase. By asking if I have donated, the last line could be changed to something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much for donating to support our efforts to&#8230;. Your continued support is vital to your success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, these small things don&#8217;t preclude me from recommending that nonprofits who accept donations on their website (and if you don&#8217;t <a href="mailto:jake@shoeinthedoor.com">let&#8217;s talk</a>) experiment with this tool. One way to ease into it would be to show it not to every user on your site but it a subset of users.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about implementing this tool and need any technical help, just <a href="mailto:jake@shoeinthedoor.com">let me know</a></p>
